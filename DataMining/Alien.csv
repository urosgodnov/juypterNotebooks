0,kalle-parviainen,High-budget Alien fan film,7,"A few hours after coming out of the theater and I'm not sure what to make of this. It was... okay, I guess?It felt like Fedy Alvarez examined the production of each of the previous films, and every left-over idea from them was thrown finally to the screen, along with rehashing the core components of the franchise. You have pieces from Alien, Aliens, Resurrection, and Prometheus/Covenant. For a fan of the series, there are subtle and not-so-subtle easter eggs every few minutes, from sound effects to reused dialogue.The plot is really simple, as it should be. A group of people exploring a space station. Been there, done that. However, I really liked the use of temperature and gravity in this film, those were something not seen much in this universe. And there were plenty of jump scares. I'm not usually a fan of those, but this time they worked well.The two lead actors were pretty good, the rest rather forgettable. And not sure what to make of the beyond-the-grave role of one actor...The world is great. Forget the sleek and clean world of Prometheus, this is back to the ugly 70s retro futuristic stuff. Simply lovely. Aesthetically pleasing, if you like this kind of look.Finally, however, it does feel like there is really nowhere for this franchise to go in terms of story. I wouldn't call it artistically bankrupt, but it is close. While this film tied neatly together the ""proper"" Alien films and the new Prometheus sidestep, it is hard to think what more to make of this creature. Nearly all the mystery has been stripped from the Xenomorph. I do wonder, is there anything left to do with this creature? More stand-alone films?",2024-08-14
1,andyelliott-53082,An Alien Greatest Hits album sung by a cover band.,6,"Positives first - Good action, great practical special effects, and nice visuals.Director Fede Alvarez and his production team have captured the gloomy atmosphere of Alien, and the thrilling action of Aliens almost perfectly. The action was thrilling with some scary moments.The use of practical effects and realistic miniatures was so refreshing to see in this age of CGI overkill. Seeing a fully realised Xenomorph in the flesh blew me away, and the Space scenes were beautiful. This camera work, visual presentation, and use of quality albeit limited CGI when necessary was excellent.Negatives - Average acting, nostalgia bait story, copy & pasted dialogue from better Alien movies, and the inclusion of lore elements from the inferior prequels which I wish did not exist in official canon. Plus the reveal of the villain was an ""oh, get out of here "" moment, I will say no more.Apart from the great lead actress Spaeny playing up her role, the other cast of actors/characters was just okay. I thought the nostalgia bait story was boring, eye-rolling, and almost 4th wall breaking, it ruined the immersion for me. I'm getting bored of sequels/prequels heavily relying on lazy ""remember-berries"" to get a kick out of the casual audience while making the Alien fans embarrassed almost angry. To be honest it's just lazy script writing, and disrespectful to the other Alien movies that did it first!. Unnecessary.Also the overuse of copy & pasted dialogue from the better Sigourney Weaver Alien movies was very cringe. 20th Century Studios should've called it Alien: Remember because of the over-reliance on oh you remember this bit from.. Lastly, trying to inject all the controversial and franchise damaging Prometheus nonsense into the film was frustrating, I hated all that origin of the Space Jockey and creation of the Xenomorph rubbish. And don't get me started on the villain, I don't want to spoil anything, but it was laughably lazy.I think setting the movie between the first 2 films was a mistake because you have to make your movie fit into the established continuity of the franchise with all the tie ins and plot beats required to make it fit. They should've done a sequel set years after Alien: Resurrection, and setup the start of a brand new Alien saga long after Weavers adventures (and with better writers onboard).This had the potential to be right up there with Aliens, but due to disappointing characters, a lacklustre ""remember-berry"" story, and poor script, it was a let down. Alien: Romulus, an above average Alien greatest hits movie, 4th best film in the franchise.",2024-08-17
2,bradaviel,The Rogue One of the Alien Franchise,8,"I had high hopes for this one and what can I say : I just got back into the theatre again after the first showing because I couldn't wait to see it a second time. Remember how we always wondered if Alien and Blade Runner took place in the same universe ? The world building was so well done and involving I was almost disappointed to remember after 30 minutes that I was to see an Alien movie. Almost. Because the rest is so good. The way the characters are built in relation to each other and against what's happening is masterful. I also love how the movie reunites thematically and lore wise ALL 6 movies that came before (there's a node to each and everyone of them and I'm a sucker for a good candy if it's done purposefully) while doing it's own thing. Because it IS a Fede Alvarez movie, as fresh and dynamic as the other movies he's done. Finally, you just have to see the opening : as soon as the computer lights up, you know where you are and you know it's gonna be as respectful and familiar as possible. True, there are liberties taken with the lore and some will argue on these with reason but I personally can forgive those shortcuts because they serve the pace (and every movie has its own specific Xenomorphs anyway). There's no down time, always something happening. It checks the boxes but it's also unique and special. This was well worth the wait.",2024-08-14
3,Pigeons1,"""In space no one can hear you sigh""",6,"At this point in 2024, there are more bad alien movies than good ones. So, something that pays homage to the originals really piqued my interest.Visually, it's vintage ""Alien/s"" albeit with modern polish. It looks great, spectacular even, especially the space scenes. The opening scene was perfect.The main problem with the movie is that there is zero tension, no sense of dread, and it's not scary, except for the last few scenes, which I enjoyed.The movie tries to force tension and intensity with another plot device on top of the alien-the equivalent of a bomb timer countdown. It doesn't work as it trumps the alien threat, they become inconvenient road blocks.The facehuggers have been reduced to annoying pests-something you can just bat away.The aliens are cannon fodder, and the cast just seems to bump into them. I didn't get the sense that they were being hunted. E.g The sentry cannon scene from Aliens, this movie references. But you don't see the aliens dieing in Aliens, you do here which makes them look weak. On a side note this scene also reminded me of the Starwars prison corridor ""boring conversation anyway"".Many scenes played out like a QuickTime event in a video game, with characters over-explaining and then narrating their actions: ""I'm going to press X to do this."" It's as if the audience needs to be told what they're watching and why they should feel scared or tense because there is no tension in the scene, despite an alien being present.I have concerns about adding more law etc into the franchise. I don't need to know how the alien works, it's not scary if you know everything about a monster. That's the point of a monster. They use this new found law to get past some aliens, again it was like a scene from a video game.It really nails the alien aesthetic, its a high paced movie with video game level writing and characters. Somewhat fun but ultimately disposable.",2024-08-15
4,pootc,All too familiar,6,"Alien: Romulus delivers a gritty experience reminiscent of the original film, with impressive world-building and familiar tech that longtime fans of the franchise will appreciate. The movie captures the essence of the Alien universe, offering a standalone story that fits well within the established timeline and cleverly nods to Prometheus.However, the film's reliance on callbacks to previous entries in the franchise detracts from its originality. While some references are clever, others are forced and cringeworthy.The introduction of the main character Rain, played by Cailee Spaeny, feels uninspired. We've seen this before - another Ripley. It's actually David Jonsson's character, Andy, who ends up being the most interesting by a long shot. If there is one franchise that would benefit from exploring new characters rather than rehashing old ones, this is it.Despite these negatives, Romulus is technically impressive. It's beautifully shot, the effects are good, it has some genuine scares, and manages to deliver solid thrills and action scenes that are sure to please. I just wish it were brave enough to carve out its own identity.",2024-08-17
5,zeki-4,This movie shows what is wrong with Hollywood today!,6,"Sure to be a crowdpleaser and produced to perfection this greatest hits album catering to generation Z, doesn't really tread new ground. Don't you dare to be original like 'Prometheus' or bold, like 'Alien: Covenant'. Just give the audience familiarity and play it somewhat safe.In a world where most new movies coming out from Hollywood are either reboots, remakes or sequels and where new ideas being greenlit are things of the past (unless it can be made on a small budget), we are being flooded with try-to-check-all-boxes movies with several screenwriters and focusgroups attached.Consider me worried.",2024-08-20
6,valmont1702,"Checks all the boxes, and more !...",8,"If you love the Alien franchise, there's a big chance this movie is gonna satisfy you quite a bit... Because it combines most of the notable elements that made the franchise oh so popular across the years (cf. There are multiple winks or easter eggs to the various movies of the franchise, via subtle elements, characters or story plots)...It is of course a product of our modern era (the filming technics, the effects), while also keeping most of the classic atmosphere and tone of the Alien movies...The visual language is pretty excellent overall, with some really striking shots here and there (great framing and composition)...Yes it might disappoint some, who have a feeling of ownership towards the franchise, because it definitely expands and explores the lore quite a lot (which is what I personally am looking for with sci-fi sagas that go on and on over decades)... Also, the lead actress (Cailee Spaeny) carries the movie really well, with silent strength, subtlety and intensity...So if you're looking for an Alien movie that uses most of the old ingredients while reintroducing and/or reinventing them, and exploring beyond what we've been used to... Then you're up for a great time !",2024-08-14
7,michaelsnyder-59725,"No Depth, No Soul",6,"Was truly hoping for something better given the decent number of positive reviews. But this was one-note through and through. No real tension, once you realize the generic script was going to stay that way. The 'twist' was as predictable as they come. Acting generic. Though Andy had his moments. The throwbacks to previous films were eye rolling and the rehash of the famous Aliens line was the most cringe of all. Even some of the sets looked cheap. I particularly remember a couple scenes that looked like they were hanging up those circular metallic bendable dryer vents. Everything was super dark, probably to hide what was probably terrible quality alien slime/hard mucus lining the walls. The face huggers particularly at the beginning looked very cheaply done. Stiff and jittery.Big letdown.",2024-08-17
8,enzo_gd,Disappointing and childish,3,"I didn't like the movie at all. It was just a mess of red lights and repeated visual effects, an uninspired collage of shots that recall scenes from each and every Alien movie. What was the point of making something like this? Was it to put the final nail in the coffin for the Alien saga? It seems long overdue!The inclusion of teenagers in the plot is completely illogical, even if they are supposedly tech-savvy. We're not talking about using a microwave or the latest smartphone here; this is advanced space technology! The whole thing is nonsense, with incoherent storytelling and a lack of real suspense. I've wasted two hours of my time !",2024-10-15
9,thatsgottahurt-1,Bland and Uninspired,6,"Let me just say that I have been with this franchise since day one. I can remember seeing the original in the cinema before I was a teenager. I have seen and enjoyed all the films many times over and appreciated the less popular ones in the series. Seeing Romulus was a disappointment. Its dark visuals, particularly the opening sequence, had me confused at times. The relevance of the opener became obvious later on. And the dialogue was muffled in spots, and I missed chunks trying to figure out what was said, thus missing the follow up. The story was uninspiring and the Xenomorphs were identical to previous incarnations (for the most part) and close ups of the mouth parts no longer cause fear or dread, just boredom. This is one in the franchise that I may not watch again.",2024-08-17
10,SeeRJay,Patience will be rewarded - the third act makes the trip worthwhile,9,"First and foremost, Alien: Romulus is an unabashed love letter to Alien, Aliens and - much to my delight - Alien: Isolation. There hasn't been a film or piece of media that has felt quite as loyal to the original's vision in a long time, if ever.Almost to a fault, the first two acts deify Alien and Aliens, occasionally lifting dialogue and scene composition verbatim. Those parts are nice throwbacks, although I couldn't help but want something fresh and genuinely terrifying - a feat which I don't think has been achieved since the films that Alien: Romulus lovingly imitates. At the very least, it never ceases to be engaging science fiction-horror.The characters are moderately interesting, with some believable backstories to justify their motivations, but it isn't difficult to distinguish the heroes from the fodder early on. The dynamic between Rain and Andy is a particular highlight, and gives the narrative the anchor that it needs to warrant the audience's investment. Cailee Spaeney's and David Jonsson's performances are excellent, with the latter delivering the nuance required of his character with precision. The practical effects are also fantastic, making the CGI - when it is used - stand out to the film's detriment.While the first two acts in isolation deliver a satisfactory entry in the series, the third act (you will know when it arrives) is the white-knuckle horror ride that has been lacking in the more recent films. It's also the point in which the film matures, so to speak, distinguishing itself from a homage and transforming into a standalone experience. It really is best viewed free of any spoilers - all I will say is that it is the first time I've involuntarily gasped in the series since seeing Alien for the first time.Patience will be rewarded - the third act makes the ride more than worthwhile, and reminded me of exactly why I love the series.",2024-08-14
11,thewatcher-67734,A very average addition to the Alien universe,6,"Nothing special, a lot of the really positive reviews are overhyped.The characters for the most part are totally flaccid and devoid of any real character, apart from Andy. I honestly didn't have any emotional attachment to the majority of the characters and most of them were just annoying and thick.The movie was tawdry at times, seeming to take an age to get going and relying far to heavily on Alien franchise cliches to add any real colour to the plot and script.The special effects were good enough and the design on the original xenomorph was excellent, although the face huggers look worse in this film than they did in Alien and Aliens for some reason.Don't ger over excited by the current hype surrounding Romulus, it isn't a terrible film but it isn't a great one either. As a huge fan of the originals, i came away disappointed.",2024-08-17
12,obrechtandreas,Full of clichees and target audience are def teens,8,"I read it was supposed to be a straight to VOD movie and to be released on Hulu. They should have sticked with that. What a disappointment.The beginning is garbage, they used some teens, with some really dumb cliche personalities. Just annoying. Once the action gets going, you do have lots of good moments but overall so many over the top moments, it was clearly made to be more of a teen action movie.No real horror or mystery elements. And repeating, extremely repeating, always adding one more layer on layer but always the same.Then the end, last 10min were nice, but then again so dumb behavior and moves that you can just laugh and shake your head.Where are the beautiful mystery elements from prometheus and covenant?A real pity. I really hoped for more. It was a let down and a 7.5 rating, that can't be real. Seriously haha.",2024-08-15
13,maue-19674,Lazy Patchwork of call backs & dialogue from previous Alien films,6,"A group of young disaffected workers on a Weyland-Yutani mining Colony hatch a plan to go scavenge cryo-pods from what appears to be an abandoned ship orbiting their world with a view to heading away from their dead-end existence to a new system. However, once at the ship they find it is actually a Weyland-Yutani research facility and, although there are no humans left aboard, it is far from empty....I am a huge fan of the Alien Films and had watched the approach of this 7th Film with a mixture of both curiosity and trepidation. After all, Alien Films are not released very regularly and the 'Fanbase' has now polarised into two camps - one that simply wants to watch 'more of the same' Alien (Xenomorph on scary spaceship picking off victims etc) or those who want a bigger exploration of the 'Alien Universe' (Prometheus, Covenant).Despite the endorsements of both Ridley Scott & James Cameron (now both in hock to the 'Mouse-house' Disney) I suspected that this Film would be a 'mash up' of sorts between 'Alien' & 'Aliens' - just with a younger Cast. Unfortunately, Disney have shown that they are creatively bankrupt and are more than happy to simply produce a 'copy & paste' rehash of what we have seen before...
Alien: Romulus has a couple of good set pieces and a couple of decent acting performances BUT it just cannot disguise the fact that it is a patchwork of nods & call backs to virtually every Alien Film made! Whole chunks of dialogue and lines are spouted verbatim from 'Alien' and 'Aliens', which was just an unnecessary distraction. The 'Rook/Ash' inclusion was also overdone. The net result for me was a Film that looked and sounded like a Lazy reboot of several Alien Films but with NO original ideas. The practical effects were well done BUT the impact was diminished by the overly familiar tropes - and dialogue.The 'Finale' was blatant 'remix' of the creature from 'Alien Resurrection' with a bit of 'Prometheus' Engineer thrown in!Cailee Spaeny makes an endearing if reluctant hero as Rain, while David Jonsson's 'artificial person' Andy struggles with his 'directives'. Unfortunately neither of these two can match Weaver's original Ripley or Fassbender's deeply unnerving 'David' from the other Films.So, Alien: Romulus (for me) simply didn't do anything to expand the Alien Universe or indeed even go for a more original take. Instead I found myself watching a 2 hour 'replay' of 'Alien Greatest Hits' which appeared to have been designed for 'Fanboys' and video-game youngsters. In some parts I even felt it bordered on parody!As for this being the 'Best' Alien Film since Cameron's 'Aliens' in 1986 - forget it!At least Alien 3, 'Prometheus' and even 'Covenant' tried to be different.'Alien: Romulus' has successfully rehashed all the old Alien tropes for a new audience but, in the process, has now painted the Franchise into a corner.The 'haunted spaceship' has now been done to death - unless Scott himself has anything further to say, Alien is going nowhere...",2024-08-31
14,melllettem,Confusing combination of all the 6 movies,6,"I hoped that this movie will add something new to the story of the franchise, but it is just a standalone average horror movie. As I see the director and the studio misunderstood the fans when their problems were raised about Prometheus and Covenant and the result of it is a confusing combination of all the 6 movies also some stolen John Carpenter feeling in the end.Inspite of this there where some enjoyable scenes in the movie, the main character is likeable but despite all efforts Romolus remains a strange spin-off of the Alien universe.Of course for an Alien fan it is a mandatory piece even if it's a one time movie.",2024-08-15
15,kcsuper,The Director gets it!,8,"Managed to snag an early screening of Alien: Romulus, and let me just say this....... Fede Alvarez understands the suspense this franchise needs. Despite the obvious inspiration from the Alien: Isolation video game, which is not a bad thing AT ALL, Alvarez provides the old school fan service we've been missing.The not-so well known cast pulls it off convincingly, particularly Cailee Spaeny as Rain. Although I didn't much care for her character in Civil War, here she sells her performance rather well. Many will view her as primarily an Amanda Ripley knock-off, though. The Xenomorph design in this one is somewhat reminiscent of the original '79, and it does NOT disappoint. It's almost as if ""Kane's Son"" from the Nostromo floated through space and landed on the Renaissance Station.That feeling of isolated dread carries the film, and keeps you on the edge of your seat, but it has has a tendency to drag, but you barely notice it. As far as facehuggers go.......this film does them justice! Holy 🐄! They give the creatures they spawn a run for their money as top contender for terrifying. Take the ones who attacked Ripley and Newt in Aliens and dip them in cocaine. That's what you get in this one! All in all, Alien: Romulus comes in third in this franchise. Alien 3, Resurrection, Prometheus, and Covenant can be erased from canon in my opinion. Enjoy fans!",2024-08-14
16,Zetsurin,Great start let down by some bad choices,6,"Thw movie starts well. In fact the first 2/3rds is pretty great. But it is let down in various ways:Too many needless quotes spoken word for word from previous films as if that will excite our nostalgia, but honestly those lines were delivered perfectly with impact and timing when used originally and just repeating this as off the cuff dialog in new characters treads far too closely to ruining their legacy.Some connections to previous films that I don't like are validated. The lore appears to be permanently lessened as to the origin of the species amongst other things.Some scenes and situations from previous films are copied, again needlessly. There are several of these.At times it feels like there are jump scares every 5 minutes in parts, way overdone. Less is more IMHO, otherwise it starts to just devolve into a generic slasher movie.",2024-08-15
17,daryl-b-t,Lacking Originality,6,"A bit disappointing, a lot of copying moments from the earlier movies, very much the same look and feel. A few too many corridors.Also, rather throw away characters who really needed a lot more depth to truly come alive. Can honestly say we walked out of the cinema not remembering the name of anyone, never a good sign.Probably they're going to get absolutely roasted for dumb not science moments, like spaceships that slow down when the engines turn off....unfortunately one of many.Revisiting the Alien universe was enjoyable, and if you're a fan it's probably worth watching. It will be interesting to see if it appeals to the younger market it's obviously aimed at.",2024-08-14
18,and_mikkelsen,A movie for the fans!,8,"I have to admit, I was skeptic going into this movie, since the later trailers made me worty that they showed the whole movie, cause it was going to be bad... however I was thankfully wrong!This was such a pleasent surprise, and felt like the biggest breath of fresh air, after prometheus and covennant!You can tell that the director loves the franchise, and that he went back to the first two movies, saw what worked, and why they were loved by the fans, and then combined them into making this movie! We even get some Alien Isolation vibes!The story and action takes its time to get going, but thats part of the charm with these movies! I enjoy that slow burn until things go crazy! Taking its time to establish the characters, the setting, the rules etc!I loved how many practical effects that they used! Thats another part of the charm and why the first movies are so great, compared to the later ones! The experience becomes more immersive, rather tvan having all that CGI to pull you out og it!Overall a movie that exceeded my expectations, and might become my favorite outside the first two!",2024-08-15
19,Platypuschow,"Alien Romulus: Expectations, exceeded",7,"PlotWhile scavenging the deep ends of a derelict space station, a group of young space colonists come face to face with the most terrifying life form in the universe.CastA mostly young cast of folks I barely or don't even know.Spaeny was a passable lead and Jonsson was the stand out performer of the movie.VerdictI love xenomorphs, I don't always like the movies they're in however. In fact when creating my Aliens/Predator universe best to worst list I was alarmed at just how low the average ratings were and after the likes of Prometheus and Convenant I had little to no faith this would be good.I often skip trailers as they spoil too much but as my expectations were already low I decided there'd be no harm and I'd likely not be rushing to watch it anyway. I was immediately concerned by the young cast, it just didn't work for me and I feared this would damage the movie further. Then I remembered I thought the same thing about the ill fated Willow (2022) and was proven wrong so kept an open mind going in.The first thing you notice is the feeling that you're in that familiar Alien universe, it presents this exceptionally well. Then it builds up that familiar dread and does it fantastically well, a nice slow burn but doesn't leave it too late to deliver lots of xenomorph action.The pacing is great, the delivery is mostly solid although I will argue that in a couple of places both the xeno's and facehuggers look a bit hokey.The movie has several very memorable sequences and more intelligence than I expected, this was actually really quite good stuff and though flawed in areas most of it was entirely forgivable.Sadly it presented us with a rather naff finale, it reminded me greatly of the end of Alien: Resurrection which a lot of fans of the series would rather forget. It didn't kill the film for me but it certainly damaged it.Alien Romulus fell as the 3rd best movie from the Alien/Predator series, I enjoyed it and am now looking forward to more which I haven't been able to say for a very longtime.RantsSo let's talk about that line, that iconic line from Alien (1986) which for some reason they decided to replicate here. Now I'm all for fan service, in many instances I think it's needed and can certainly benefit a movie. I mean after all Deadpool & Wolverine was almost entirely fan service! But there's a time and a place and sometimes it's so poorly done or unnecessary it pulls you out of the illusion and reminds you that you're watching a movie and the line in question here is an example. The sad thing is which made it so much worse is which character they had deliver it! It felt so out of character, it just felt forced, awkward and I have no idea why someone thought that would be a good idea.The GoodSome great cast members especially Jonsson
A few great moments
Really feels like an Alien movie
Very tense stuff
Mostly well madeThe BadA few bits look hokey

20,sgarfield-5-82315,Typical Disney,1,"Going in I had high hopes for this movie as the last 2 were so well done. This one however, lost the identity of the Alien franchise. As for as I could see, the only similarities between this one and any of the other Alien movies, (including AvP) was the face huggers and the xenomorph. Other than that, this one fell flat and hard. Some of the special effects were good but so were the effects in the new Star Wars. Speaking of Star Wars, that's pretty much what this was, an all inclusive Disney movie filled with British teenage actors. I can only hope that the writers at Disney/Twentieth Century Fox will one day redeem themselves and make a decent quality movie again.",2024-11-25
21,twilight-zone-1,Only worth seeing because of its great production design and visuals,6,"The Alien movie for the Gen Z . . .Since almost 40 years they try to make another great Alien movie and they fail again and again. Alien: Romulus is unfortunately not an exception. It's even worse than the other previous films. At least they had an own vision and identity, but this one is just an overloaded sample of all Alien movies' (even the prequels') most remarkable ideas, scenes and dialogues - and that in a bad way.The basic idea, the scenario and the first hour are ok and let shine through potential. Two or three own, new ideas are good. That's it.Above all - the movie is not really suspenseful and terrifying. Xenomorph attacks are directed surprisingly quite uninspired and boring. Plot holes, shallow characters and an unrealistic, far too rushed pacing make matters worse.The only reasons i don't give it less than six stars is because of the really well-made dirty, retro-homage production design, the stunning photography and the decision to use as far as possible practical effects.",2024-08-20
22,TiffJobs,A Stale Rehash of Past Glories,6,"Romulus feels like a recycled version of past Alien movies, offering nothing new to the franchise. It heavily reuses elements we've already seen in earlier films. The plot is a near copy of Alien: Resurrection, with Weyland-Yutani recovering a xenomorph and, predictably, things going wrong. Once again, we have a team of people getting killed by the alien, and even the hybrid creature at the end is just a weaker version of what was done before.The movie is packed with constant references to older Alien films, from dialogue to set pieces, but instead of feeling fresh, it just reminds you of how great the original movies were. While the technical aspects of Romulus are fine, it offers nothing new and simply rehashes what we've already seen. For fans hoping for something innovative, this movie will feel like a disappointing repeat of the past.",2024-09-29
23,Dvir971,A Thrilling Cinematic Experience,8,"After a lot of anticipation and build-up, ""Romulus"" is here and it is a very decent addition to the ""Alien"" saga.One of the most praiseworthy aspects of this film series is how the ""Alien"" series manages to achieve a rather rare blend of genres. This series, and especially this film more than any other, manages to create a rare combination of the Sci-Fi and the Horror genre, delivering a film with all the motifs of a horror movie but set in a science fiction setting. Ghosts? Demons? Serial killers? What if, for a change, they were Aliens? This refreshing combination is what makes the film series so fascinating and unique, and this film, made by one of the rising horror directors in recent years, takes it to new levels.Now, regarding the burning question that many have probably thought about-how relevant is it to refresh your memory on the other films in the series before watching this one? It is, of course, recommended to watch them all, but if you need to prioritize, it's important to know that there's much more significance in rewatching the prequel films (""Prometheus"" and ""Alien: Covenant""), which the film references and builds upon much more significantly than the original four films.In terms of world-building, which is very prominent in the first two classic films and also in the prequels, this film continues to expand the cinematic universe of the series in a fascinating way. Despite thinking that we've seen it all already, it manages to give a new spin to existing elements that were established in the other films, in a way that leaves room for future films.Cailee Spaeny carrying the film brilliantly as the lead role, and David Johnson continues the legacy of the brilliantly acted Androids throughout the series with a very impressive show of acting. Alvarez did an amazing job with the directing- and atmosphere is probably the best aspect of the film.Benjamin Wallfisch which is a student of the greatest ever, Hans Zimmer, was responsible for the music in the film- with a masterful blend of a more traditional score that references the musical mortifs of the older films, combined with electronic sounds which creates a very effective score that serves as fitting to the hybrid Sci-Fi/Horror genre.This brings me to the next point-watching this film in an IMAX theater is an amazing experience that you must not miss. High-budget horror films capable of exploiting the advantages of the IMAX format to enhance the film's impact on the viewer are rare, and this film manages to do so in an exceptional way. The thrilling sound that surrounds you from every direction and the stunning visuals are fully utilized on the giant screen-with top-notch effects, impressive set design that remains consistent with the rest of the series, and an atmosphere that evokes terror from the very first moment.Romulus is a great addition to the Alien saga, that opens the pathway to new opportunities for the franchise while still remaining true to the essence of the original series and the amazing prequels. Very recommended, especially for fans of the genre(s) and the series.",2024-08-14
24,infinitejester-07075,ALIEN: THE FORCE AWAKENS,6,"ALIEN: ROMULUS starts off well enough with a new set of characters (Including an interesting android named Andy) on a new world with an intriguing premise. The atmosphere is dark and gloomy and we know nothing good is going to happen to any of these people, but it's an ALIEN movie and that is to be expected. The problem is the director didn't believe in his own movie. As JJ Abrams did with THE FORCE AWAKENS and Star Wars, Director Alvarez followed suit by essentially remaking every previous Alien movie all in one film including numerous cringeworthy references that were neither exciting to hear nor did they add anything to the film other than making it feel cheap. The last time a one liner reference was good was when Arnold Schwarzenegger reached his hand out to Sarah Conor and said ""Come with me if you want to live."" A great use of a reference line that has never been imitated with any effectiveness. What could have been a fun and decently original ALIEN movie ended up feeling like a rehash of previous, better films. The ""brand"" seeped into the film and got in the way, and as a result, lessened the quality of yet another big budget franchise film which didn't leave me hoping for more. But alas, I'm sure one day we will get another generically titled ""ALIEN: REMUS.""",2024-08-16
25,barefootstallion,"Mostly Just More of the Same, but...",6,"My first takeaway was that there was just nothing there to get emotionally invested in - in the story or the characters. The characters just came off as cardboard cutouts, no story arcs for them, no real emotional content for you to connect with. The story was pretty much just recycled from the previous Alien films. Monster gets loose and starts killing everyone. As a result, there was no dramatic or tension buildup. You pretty much know exactly how everything is going to pan out, not long after you're introduced to the characters and the situation. Oh, and let's throw in a thumb-your-nose at how evil corporations are, just for flavor. Which, with how it was done, came off as more of an eye-roll, than something to connect with.The only saving grace the movie had, were the special effects. The ""space"" ones, that is. The creature effects were just more of what has been seen in all of the movies previous. But they did a really good job with physics with the space shots. Those were truly fun to watch. But that was pretty much it.Nothing new, nothing to surprise anyone. Just another ""Alien"" movie, one each. Ho hum.",2024-10-14
26,Human_hair,Made-for-TV teenage adventures in space,2,"They finally made a movie worse than Covenant.From the beginning it doesn't feel like it's in the Alien universe, for all its production and flair, there's no sense of scale, weight or place.The vague plot lacks any tension or jeopardy. A string of cheap callbacks to the previous movies feel incongruous and break the immersion. The xenomorphs are strangely unthreatening, like NPCs lurking in the shadows and are dispatched way too easily.Character development is also non-existent, their motivations are unclear and you don't care what happens to any of them. Andy was interesting, but nothing new.I admire how ridiculous the third act gets, but like the rest of the movie it's unfulfilling and disappointing.Romulus is akin to a beautiful, detailed, AI generated image trained on your favourite artist.

27,jtindahouse,Takes a while to get going but once it does it is relentless,7,"I usually wouldn't be overly excited about another 'Alien' sequel coming out, however in his short career so far Fede Alvarez has proven he has a lot of talent. So I went in with an open mind hoping to be pleasantly surprised that this series still has some life to it. And I'm pleased to say it does.The film gets off to a slow start. There is a solid 40 minute build-up, introducing the characters and setting up the story. That part of the movie was a little slow and drawn out for my liking. After that though, once the action/horror begins, it doesn't relent. The pacing from there on out is terrific.The movie looks good. The creatures in particular really popped on the screen. The set design was also great. It's a really hard film to fault on that front.Be warned the film is quite dark. I saw it in a cinema so there was no trouble following the action, but when it comes to streaming I could see it being an issue for people potentially.There's nothing ground-breaking or game-changing here, however if you're wanting nothing more than a good time for two hours this one could just do the trick. 7/10.",2024-08-14
28,snippetiest_ampoules,A Breath Of Fresh Air,9,"The movie's plot is clear and easy to follow, with a coherent narrative that allows the audience to quickly understand each character's motivations and predict their actions (cough cough... unlike other films in the franchise which heavily prioritised action over plot / horror). Furthermore, in this film the characters decisions make sense, and their desires are well communicated, making the plot more engaging.The movie is set in a dystopian world that depicts late-stage capitalism of the no surprise evil WY corpo, with a dark and gritty tone that reminded me and like other reviewers said of Blade Runner.While the movie has its flaws, particularly with most of the cast being somewhat forgettable, the dynamic between Andy and Rain truly stands out and carries the movie. One can really root for the said duo unlike (in contrast) to the rest of the cast. However despite this flaw the overall performance (acting wise) of the entire cast was still commendable.An additional point is that the movie starts slowly, but the wait ultimately bears its fruits leading to an intense action packed second act full of horror and gore. Some tense moments were also thrown in making you stay at edge of your seat.And oh boy, the final act takes a mysterious and deeply unsettling turn, introducing elements that are both creepy and disturbing (and maybe kinda new ?) (without giving away any spoilers). Overall, the film is a solid entry in the franchise, offering a more thoughtful narrative without sacrificing the thrills.Tldr : This movie is really a breath of fresh air for the franchise.",2024-08-14
29,apark-61202,Very high highs and Marianas trench lows,6,"Alien: Romulus brings a typical three act story filled with the twists and turns you'd expect and just a few you wouldn't.Act one sets up the movie wonderfully. It effectively gets you very familiar with the characters in only the first few minutes. So by the time the ""$hit hits the fan"" at the 30 minute mark or so, you really feel for the people on screen. Half an hour may seem like a long introductory period, but this one in particular is done so masterfully. This initial phase of the story is packed with masterful cinematography, very proficient acting overall (theres a clunky line or two but nothing earth shattering. And mind you this is amidst some very good acting.), surprisingly rich symbolism, and a wonderfully handled, perfectly paced acceleration into the hell that awaits this time around.Act two of this film is classic horror of a high caliber. I was on the edge of my seat for this entire middle section of what felt like around 45 minutes. Visceral, realistic, paced just as well as the first thirty minutes, and oh so suspenseful. I felt like I was with these characters in their journey through the jaws and slimy...tailz...things of xenomorphs and facehuggers. Pleasant surprises to me in this portion of the movie was a great deal of thematic depth, and some (randomly) superb acting from David Johnsson. I hope to see more of him.Act three is where things (for some reason) take a turn for the worst. Ill just say this, A certain character makes a certain stupid decision lacking any quality motivation, and from that point on, I knew with very little doubt the outline of the rest of the film. As if this questionable creative decision from the writers didn't rip me out of the movie enough, (as im sure you've guessed) this third act of the movie drags you through every damned cliche in the book. Its not just cliche, though. It feels remarkably lazy, extremely messy, and dashed my hopes for a wonderful finale. And it tries to cram this trashy storytelling down your throat with shock value from some nasty scenes. Honestly, the movie could have and should have ended at the 1:25 ish mark when a character says ""I'll find my way back"" and it would have been perfect. It seemed like the movie was originally meant to end there, but the studio decided at the last second they wanted another half hour, and this half hour was written in...half an hour.If you turn this movie off when that line is said (mostly using this line as a reference point, but it truly would make a decent ending), then its a crack shot. Solid 7.8/10. The rest of it in my opinion, is total garbage and brings the wonderful first hour and a half down so badly that I can't rate this movie above a 6.5/10.",2024-08-17

Too much time running around In corridors, not enough aliens, no tension building. Some of the editing is a little odd, and many missed opportunities that could have been darker and more gritty. All in all it never really seemed to get going, and relied too heavily on familiar tropes pulled from previous outings in this universe.On the good side, the effects and world building and performances are all solid, it's just not enough to give this the impact it needs to propel itself forwards.",2024-08-14
32,pajdagog,Back to roots,8,"Alien franchise took a bit of a nose dive lately, video games being an honest exception. Creators of Romulus valianltly pulled up by returning to atmosphere, aestetics and most of the crew of 1986´Aliens, as well as the original Alien from 1979. If these originals are lynchpins of your cinematic experience, like they were to me, then Romulus is (a lot) more of the same - and that´s GOOD thing.Xenomorphs salivates and scares, vacuum kills, low temperature freezes and acid burns. Nobody insults our inteligence by removing their space helmets when meeting alien lifeforms or concocting (sucking from a thumb) deep philosophical conundrums about origins of human race.Actors are turning in very adequate work, however, with the exception of David Jonsson, they do not create very distinct characters and are largely interchangeable. Maybe I am wrong and ten years from now, God willing, I will be pointing at screen, screaming: ""Hey! That´s Cailee Spaeny, the chick from Romulus!"" Maybe not.With clear conscience, I can say go and watch Romulus..",2024-08-17

Still not a bad movie though just nothing I'd go out of way to watch, effects were good apart from that atrocious deepfake and a few scenes were enjoyable to watch, you can see the team behind it are experienced you have good build ups, use of audio was probably the best out of everything honestly some of best I've seen match the scenes perfectly with great build ups but it's just the lack of a real plot that ruined it honestly with a story 8/10 I'm not much of a diehard aliens fan so you might enjoy it more but for the names under this movie it's hot garbage. I'd just wait for it to stream did feel like I was watching a netflix original and not even a great one at that.I'm guessing it's a test run to see how the audience reacts to more alien films felt like the studio just seeing if they can milk the franchise anymore.",2024-08-15

It is so sad to see a jewel being devalued. Nothing makes sense, the succession of plots is much too fast, it feels like being in a fast-food restaurant. The culture of speed to the detriment of quality. Seeing untrained children competing with aliens is an insult to intelligence. There is no depth to the script, the characters and even the setting, that is to say the poverty of the whole. The franchise must respect the fans of the first hour and stop infantilizing the audience because it is a contradiction that is harmful. This film is intended for gullible children and no one else.",2024-10-18
35,tomverbart,Atmospheric but forgetabble teen slasher,6,"Every director gave it's Alien creation a distinct character. Scott created a pur sang sci-fi horror, Cameron gave Aliens a blockbuster twist, Fincher managed to create one of THE most depressing movies I have ever seen and Jeunet added some French gore sauce to the franchise. Hence, In line with Alien history I hoped Alvarez would create a proper horror movie.Unfortunately, he did not really deliver. The movie started promising with great visuals on a terraforming colony and a decent story line. Things went south rather rapidly though. The cast mostly consists of teenage characters you would expect to find in a Chipotle scrolling their phones instead of flying space craft. Why is it a crime to have some 30-40-50, or heck 60 year olds in a movie these days?Whatever, things got a bit more disappointing 20-25 minutes into the movie. The visuals are stunning, but everything was rushed and not well thought through. There was no suspense (from incubation to full maturity in less than 10 minutes?) and nothing really new was added to the Alien universe. An attempt to add some nostalgia did not land well with me and many scenes where over the top.I have to give kudos to Andy (David Jonssons) which was hands down the most interesting character in the movie.

Cailee Spaeny as the lead actress gave a solid performance as expected.

37,Ernad_Fakic,Surprise of the year.,8,"Unlike many fans of the Alien franchise, a month or two ago, I would have been the first to say that I didn't expect much from this film. However, today I spontaneously decided to watch it at the premiere in the Zagreb IMAX, and here are my impressions.What Fede Alvarez as director and executive producer, and Ridley Scott as producer, have achieved with this film is a return to the true spirit of the original movies, offering a real treat for all fans. Romulus is, after the first two installments, the best Alien sequel. I dare say it can even rival them in many ways. For those of you eagerly anticipating this film, rejoice-it's worth every moment and every cent, especially if you can watch it in a theater.As for the plot, it starts off a bit slowly, following a group of young space colonizers as they explore the deepest parts of an abandoned space station in search of a better future. Along the way, they encounter the most terrifying life form in the universe. The story doesn't deviate much from the established Alien formula, so you won't see anything entirely new in terms of narrative, but the screenplay is where the film truly shines.The characters are diverse-some are one-dimensional and serve only as fodder for the Aliens, while others are destined for more significant roles. However, the main heroine has enough characterization and charm to make us root for her, which is essential in films like this. The atmosphere is dark and terrifying. It pulls us into the cosmic darkness, making us feel quite vulnerable-at least, that's how it seemed to me. The action sequences are smartly crafted and incredibly thrilling, making the film feel shorter than its nearly two-hour runtime.The cinematography is one aspect that surprised and impressed me the most. The film looks stunning, and the IMAX format only enhances this effect. Some scenes are a true space odyssey, something rarely seen in this franchise. The music is top-notch, perfectly accompanying all the chaos on screen.In conclusion, Alien: Romulus is the most pleasant surprise of the year. Filmed in the spirit of the classic films, with a modern touch, this is a film that deserves to be seen on the big screen. As a colleague of mine said: ""We needed a good Alien film.""",2024-08-14
38,jethro-17881,Millennials vs Aliens..... a horrible dream about smothering?,7,"Well, no, not horrible in a bad way anyway. To a point that is.I'll admit to having a few reservations going into Alien Romulus. They were quite simple really; firstly the trailer showed a cast that was very young for some reason and that felt, based on very little info, a little manufactured.Secondly it's the first Alien franchise film since Disney bought Fox and lets face it the House of Mouse hasn't had a great track record with existing franchises. Seems that Mickey and Donald seem less interested in study and bringing back and more interested in wiping them franchises out...
Lastly there were a few elements that I recognised immediately as concepts or story line devices from the other films... I am proud to be a connoisseur of this franchise so it is very hard to make a call-back subtle enough for me.Despite these I was always going to see it in theatres despite having a bad feeling about this drop. Not just because its an Alien film but also because Fede Alvares has made some good films and I thought it might be safe in his and Ridley Scott's hands.So. The good news. Romulus looks great. A great deal of effort has gone into the sets, the effects both practical and CGI look (mostly) very good. The opening has a real Blade Runner feel and one gets real moments where its as if Ridley Scott's presence is behind the frames as you watch them. The sound and lighting were excellent. The feel of the film was desperate, claustrophobic, scary and tangibly gritty. Nice.The cast does a commendable job. No weak links as such though it is hard for the cast to really jump out at you as individuals. David Jonsson is the highlight for me; as the synthetic... I mean artificial person... he owns every scene he is in bringing just enough of Bishop and Ash to the story while also having some really unique and different characteristics.There are a few scenes that are very respectful of Giger's original creature design and I'll give props to Alvarez and his production design for effort made. The writers too have added some nice world building to give us a wider bigger scope of humanities presence among different worlds without going full Carl Sagan and tending towards a more realistic capitalism in space isn't really much different than capitalism in 2024 for good or ill feel. Anyone else for a lifetime of indentured servitude to Weyland Yutani corporation? I thought not but fun to see as a fiction. It will remind to question which species is worse....
Romulus also forges its own path in the genre. Is it science fiction horror, or science fiction action, or is it science fiction philosophy... Is it a stand up fight like Aliens or a bug hunt like Alien? Its more Aliens than Alien but with a Promethius slant that lacks the philosophical high brow writing and is more just in the creature designs and story devices. So solid, near full marks for taking a different course.Now the bad news.Romulus takes the existing lore and builds on it. Some of that building is... er, shall we say... off. Some is good - new elements founded on the original Alien and Aliens movies, and the Promethius ones too had me going. 'Eh??' And then... 'well alright that was pretty interesting.' But then there were ones that weren't so good. Not so good at all. I want this review to be pretty spoiler free so I wont give it a detailed analysis blow by blow but you will see what I mean. There was definitely stuff that I didn't like.At times, not the whole time, Romulus felt like a soft reboot. There were many call backs to the other films and some of them so unsubtle as to feel like Kathleen Kennedy had impregnated the writers with a quota. (My mommy always said there were no monsters, no real ones, but there are and Kennedy is one.) They were way too blatant for me. Some were fine nuanced enough to get past anyone but the most discerning franchise devotee but others almost had me say 'urgh' out loud.Like a lot of writing these days film did feel a little rushed at times - the creatures life cycle especially felt faster in this film than any of the others. There was no time taken to establish that the what was formerly a 'weird little critter' has now with time become a 'deadly big critter.' The same goes with the creature gestating inside a living human host only to have that gestation period be about ten minutes. Yikes! Why hang the hosts in the nest at all? Seems a lot of Xenomorph effort to me, why not just hold them down if its measured in just minutes.So is Romulus worth it? Yes it is. If you like this franchise you will like this film. Like me you will have your criticisms but you should see it on the big screen as they mostly come out only so now and then. Mostly.",2024-08-14

There is one so called almost ""human"" character from a previous Alien movie that fits like a glove in this movie.Advanced puppetry was merged with special effects to create a realistic and intense film which seems to outdo itself in terms of effects at every turn. If you thought the second Alien movie with the marines was scary, this movie provides way more of a fright but fans of this genre will love it. There are many storyline tidbits that borrow from previous Alien movies in the series that pay homage to what came before but they didn't overdo it so once again it works.The Alien creatures in this movie at times make your skin crawl with apprehension but it's all part of the intrigue and cinematographic enjoyment.

After some initial excitement, the movie drags again for sometime. Most things we've seen in other Alien genre films, but there are a few new twists that help connect other Alien films. And some funny homage moments as well. I'll have to rewatch this one after a while to see if my feelings change on this review. But for now, I'll wait until it's in Apple's $4.99 movie bin before I add it to my digital film collection so I have all the Alien films. My final thoughts are.. 1.

42,tayangangambar,Hmmm... What was that?,6,"Alien Romulus is a good movie to watch if you had not indulged in the previous Aliens movies. If you had, the heavy baggage of past memories and expectation from the Aliens franchise will be distracting and devastating.If I had watched this movie new without the previous Alien(s) related movies, I would say it is 7 - 8. It had a mix combination of some of the elements of the previous Aliens movies as well as Alien: Isolation game references.It is like J. J. Abram's take of Star Wars, where fan service, nostalgia and Déjà vu are key ingredients with his own interpretation and additional turns. Fede Álvarez also injected a heavy side of horror vibe in it with persistent strong enemies and helpless victim(s).I really appreciated the overall premise of the movie and how it was setup in a typical Alien formula. It tries to be minimalistic and yet have a fresh take on the Aliens franchise. However, I think its strong adaptations from the Aliens franchise is detrimental for the fans of the franchise.What I felt wanting more are:1) More character development, like flashbacks and how these group are together. Also, more needed on Rain and Andy.2) The movie seems lacked of dynamic audio in the cinema that I was watching it in (Big Screen Atmos). I am not too sure if it is due to the engineering of the audio track or on purpose to give it an old 80s movie vibe. I think there is also a bit lack of foley work to enhance the audio environment. I think the movie score is also a bit lacking in dramatics which sometimes can help make scenes be more inspiring.3) The pacing is good, but I think it was a bit too quick in term of essential story and character building.4) There seems to be a lack of mature and strong (emotionally and physically) feel in the group which should have appeared in some of the characters as they are supposed to working in the mines or what not. They are more like high school / college kids having their Stranger Things adventure.5) There is something missing in the characterization of the Aliens. I am not too sure what, need to watch this again.Edit: Too static, dull and sluggish. Needed more agility, wildlife behaviour/disposition and intelligence/personality. I.e Not taking advantage of oldie but goodie appearance due to limitations of tech/budget those days and current tech in CGI and/or animatronics. A good example would be Alien: Covenant or Yoda vs Count Dooku in Star Wars II: Attack of the Clones using CGI.6) The cinematography and editing seems a bit lacking for big budget sci-fi movie for cinemas. Move fitting for direct to streaming production. Lack some cinematics class.7) Lack of new ideas for the Aliens. With new technology for animatronics, CGI and know-how on wild life movement, behaviors and thinking, they should be more animated and intelligent creature-like, not so stiff. I guess strict guidelines were used to keep it in line with past films. The swiftness of the Aliens done in Alien 3 and Aliens Covenant is a prime example of moving forward with the Xenomorph's animation with new movie tools.8) Some new innovations were used to bring something new and shocking, but seems to have backfired or regressive for a modern sci-fi horror. A bit B-grade. Also, the adaptations from past Aliens properties to create fan service and deja vu were tiring and overused. Lack of freshness in that sense.A must see for Aliens fans and Sci-Fi horror fans, but do not expect to give it a ""chef kiss"". I left the movie dazed as I was rooting for it too much from influence of the well-made movie trailers.",2024-08-17
43,z1417,A True Homage to the Alien Franchise,10,"Great attention to detail, amazing photography and smart screenwriting makes this Alien movie the best since ALIENS.It's remarkable how they managed to connect with the original movie without coming out with some absurd storyline (""Somehow Palatine Returned""). At the same time all the ambiance truly matches the original: the tech, clothes, etc.Yes Romulus, is a slow burn, but this the same reason that made ALIEN great in the beginning, something that true horror fans will appreciate deeply.No cheap CGI, just practical effects and minimum green screen makes this one of the finest movies in the Alien franchise (yes, as one fellow reviewer said, this is truly the equivalent to Rogue One).If you're a real fan of the saga you'll be able to recognize every sound, graphic and soundtrack.Acting is good and true as well, you get to truly care for the protagonists and feel their emotions, something that previous Alien movies had failed.The movie is not afraid to innovative in some key aspects of the creature (our perfect organism), but it does it on an impecable way and true to the cannon. Where Alien 4 and Covenant failed this movie truly succeeds, the third act is great and you can only wish for a sequel in the end, I truly hope to see it.Thank you Fede and Galo, this is truly amazing movie and a future classic.

RLM nailed it when they said that it feels like the writers asked chatgpt for an amalgamation of all alien movies. This movie had good parts but ultimately took no risks. They redid popular scenes from the earlier movies trying to please the nostalgic viewers. I sadly think the alien franchise is doomed as long as disney controls it. People hated on Prometheus but at least that movie had new concepts and dared to try something new within the alien universe and I wish this movie did the same.

50,imperitrix,Too much fan service,6,"There's a lot to like about this movie, but it fails to really come together. There are way too many callbacks to previous entries, one of the actors (the one who didn't like Andy) was impossible to understand - I don't know if I understood a word he said) and some questionable editing brought everything down a notch. On the plus side, the two leads were fine, there was some good world building, and the effects were decent. I've read some complaints that the AI used to bring one of the characters to life was bad, but I thought they did a fine job.

The film captures the 'original' Alien vibe that I've missed for so long.The story is both intriguing and thrilling, packed with suspense and jump scares. The atmosphere and world-building are not only convincing but also incredibly exciting. This movie delivers everything I could have hoped for in this genre-it truly has it all.What sets it apart from other horror films is the extra layer of philosophical questions and the exploration of human greed. This added depth makes it far more than just another horror movie.",2024-08-14

I was extremely looking forward to the film that kind of fills the gap between Alien and Aliens with the same look and feel. I did get that look and feel. I did get the antmosphere and I did get some very very nice effects. What I missed was a compelling storyline. While the movie offers a lot of rerfences to literarily all previous Alien movies and does not give an interesting connection to the canon which makes it appear to be a bit useless ( not as useless as the AVP movies though ) as it did not offer anything new to the franchise except for one stupid thing which I don't want to spoiler but it appears in the last act ( that was the low point of the movie and maybe entire franchise even beating Ripley making love to a xenomorph in Part IV).It really works as an homage to all previous films, especially the first three and that's something to respect and like it for.Cast was good, really liked Cailee Speany who works well as a modern Sigourney Weaver.

On the flip side, the soundtrack and special effects were SO LOUD that everyone in the theater was blocking their ears for the entire second half. I've been to a ton of punk rock concerts, but never heard anything even half this loud-I could feel every effect in my heart.

That's my review of Alien Romulus 8/10.,2024-08-19
61,jared-25331,BEST HORROR MOVIE OF 2024!!!!!,10,"When this movie was first being announced, I was very skeptical about it for obvious reasons. But, then I heard that Fede Alvarez was going to be directing this movie and I've been a fan of that guy ever since his remake of Evil Dead (2013). Then, the teaser trailer came out and I got even more excited. And after the official trailer came out, this movie officially became my most anticipated movie of summer 2024. Then, I decided to binge thought the entire Alien Franchise earlier this month and I have liked every entry in this franchise with the exception of Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem (2007). And finally, I went to see this movie in the theater earlier today and now I can say that Alien: Romulus (2024) is easily my favorite horror movie of 2024.Positives for Alien: Romulus (2024):
This movie gives us Alein fan everything that we've wanted from this franchise since Aliens (1986). The thing that I love the most about this movie is that it went back to the horror roots of the original Alien movie. Fede Alvarez did a fantastic job at recapturing the dread, tension, haunted house vibe, sound design and claustrophobia from that original movie perfectly with his direction in this movie. This movie has the most intense atompshere that I've experienced in any movie in 2024. The production value and setting design of this space station is awesome and they even manage to recreate the graphics on how the technical would look and operate in the first two Alien movies. The performances from the entire cast are awesome and there is not one person who isn't phoning it in at all. It's also worth noting that this group of actors is compromised of newcomers from David Jonsson, Archie Renaux, Spike Fearn and Aileen Wu in her feature film acting debut down to little more well-known people like Cailee Spaeny and Isabela Merced. After watching this movie, I will most definitely be keeping my eye on all of these people because they were awesome and easily the standout performances in this movie are both Cailee Spaeny as Rain and David Jonsson as Andy, especially in regards to the relationship of those two characters. Cailee Spaeny did a fantastic job at make her character stand out on her own without feeling like a copycat of Ellen Ripley. David Jonsson was fantastic at playing the android in this movie and he is one of the more likable androids of this franchise. The practical effects with both the facehuggers and the Xenomorphs are phenomenal and it felt so good to see some practical effects in a modern movie. The facehuggers in this movie are at their most terrifying that they've ever been in this franchise. The movie also does a fantastic job at bridging the events from the original Alien series with the events from Prometheus (2012) and Alien: Covenant (2018) perfectly. And finally, the climax of this movie is one of the most intense and thrilling conclusion that I have ever seen in any horror movie.Mixed with Alien: Romulus (2024):
This movie was made specifically for the fans of this franchise and there are a lot of references to this franchise, so it is really going to depends on what you will think about these references in the long run. And finally, the climax of this movie will definitely divide audiences with the decisions being made, especially in regards to one element being recreated from an certain entry in this franchise. Luckily, I didn't have a problem with any of the decisions being made and in fact the element that is being recreated in this movie is a better version of that thing from that specific entry.Overall, I am over the moon with Alien: Romulus (2024). This movie is most definitely going to be my favorite horror movie of 2024 and that's saying a lot given the fact that we still have Terrifier 3 (2024) and Nosferatu (2024) coming out later this year. And for me personally, not only is this movie the best entry in the franchise since the first two movies, not only is it the best horror movie of the 21st Century, but this is easily one of my favorite horror movies of all time and I couldn't be any happier about that.",2024-08-20
62,dalehoustman,Dark... But Not In the Good Way,6,"I'm a bit odd: when I go to a movie I am hoping to actually SEE a movie. This film was filmed so dark that - again and again - crucial story elements are missed or nearly missed. It is quite possible to have a film that occurs in the dark without making the viewer feel as if something has either gone wrong with the projector or with their own eyes. This is one of the murkiest movies I've ever had the ""luck"" to watch. At times I am was left just guessing at what had just happened. It would have been unbearable if it wasn't that I was - as a film lover - fascinated by the sheer ineptitude of it all.Aside from that (major) flaw, the film (insofar as I could ascertain what was happening) seems to be ""Frankensteined"" from the general run of the Alien ""franchise"" (I hate that term as applied to art, as well as the idea of cinematic ""universes"" - when did people lose the ability to create a fine film one by one rather than slotting it inot a money-generating machine?)... There wasn't an original idea in the entire film, it was if I were seeing the original Alien film but recast with young adults (""In Space Everyone Is Cute!"") and then plunged into a Stygian marshland of imagery.And finally: it took forever to get the movie up to speed and yet the creators still had no time to slow down enough to give us characters we could give a hoot about. The original Alien film had distinct personalities - maybe just an Hawaiian shirt or a bit of revealing dialogue. None of that goes here, although the obligatory android character was - as usual - the most human element of the film. When you could see any of the emotions supposedly happening on screen.A really good example of film's decline.",2024-08-29

64,foxtrot-21,The curse of Prometheus,6,"It's been a while since we have seen the movie set in the ""Alien"" franchise. Ironically, Ridley Scott, who has created the whole thing, seemingly put it to the grave, thanks to ""Prometheus"" and (especially) ""Alien: Covenant"". However, as might be expected, there are legions of people who do not want the series to calmly rest in peace and will definitely try to add something to the series. Fede Alvarez is the most recent daredevil in the field.So, to calm everybody from the beginning, the movie is watchable. One of its greatest advantages is the technical aspect. There are plenty of practical effects, locations are created according to the ""cannon"" (i.e. ""Alien"" and ""Aliens""), sounds are correct, etc. Overall, this movie shows the same universe, without any annoying deviations. Starships, weapons, tools, computers - that is all we know and revere.This definitely a horror, which, I guess, was a good choice. Though all about aliens is said and done, in this movie the creatures are seen only partially and genuinely scary (for the reference, please recall the ""dinosaurs"" from ""Alien Resurrection""). The atmosphere is tense, the sound and music are used properly. Multiple action sequences reminded me of the ""Alien: Isolation"" game, which was the most successful (so far) reference to the original franchise.Characters have been created (sort of), with the protagonist and her android definitely standing out. Other people just appear on screen and are not so interesting, therefore whatever happens to them, is of the second importance to the audience.So, what is the problem here? The movie kicks off pretty well, defining the main characters and their problems, to which the adventure might be the solution. However, the deeper we are into the movie, the more ""fan service"" is presented on screen. Sometimes it is bearable, but the quotes are the most annoying of all and definitely not needed. The movie tries to be a conglomerate of four movies, i.e. ""Alien"", ""Aliens"", ""Prometheus"" and ""Coventant"", which is a big mistake, as the two latter should be completely abandoned and never mentioned again. Unfortunately, the resolution of the story has a strong mark of ""Prometheus"", which distracts the audience and affects the continuity and consistency of the movie. I think this is the problem with the ""controversy"" of ""Romulus"" - if (like me) you consider only the first two movies, then you will judge Romulus poorly. Others might be quite satisfied.To sum up, the movie is well made, entertaining to watch, unfortunately with multiple flaws, which will be a topic for debate among the die-hard fans. Was it needed, though? Of course not, the story does not push the universe in any new direction. Is it original? Hell, no! It is just a solid rehash of the franchise, with way too much of ""fan service"". I might agree to call it ""the third best Alien movie"", but only knowing that anything after Aliens is the pure garbage (""Alien 3"" is a little different story, but only because of the production problems). So, go and see, but restrain you expectations...",2024-08-16
65,arfdawg-1,This was Slated for Hulu?,8,"While scavenging the deep ends of a derelict space station for cryogenic pods, a group of young space colonists come face to face with the most terrifying life form in the universe.Let's be honest, the last few Alien movies were horrible. In fact, the only good ones were the first two.Alien Romulus re-invigorates the franchise. It's really good. Tight, with heart wrenching action and a pretty decent storyline.Some of it was a little hard to follow and some scenes didn't make much logical sense (I won't spoil it for anyone, but you'll know when you see them) but the movie keeps your interest throughout.There isn't much filler in the movie, which is good. There are a number of throwbacks to the earlier movies, which is cool too.It's hard to believe this was going to be a Hulu movie because it's way too good.",2024-08-18
66,totalovrdose,Some Originals (and Their Direct Sequels) can Never be Uncrowned,6,"Alien Romulus, in the words of my father, 'is a bit off'. It *does* take the film's core concept in new directions, while also taking inspiration from ALL four mainline Alien films (and I do mean all ~ for better AND worse), alongside the Ridley Scott prequels.The film is absolutely at its best in the sound and visual department. I would highly recommend seeing the film at the cinema for the sound alone, because much like Dune Part 2, it is a feast for the sensors, with absolutely everything sounding impactful and dangerous.This truly helps sell the idea that the universe is virtually uninhabitable for human's and their frail bodies, an idea the narrative thematically returns to. This is further represented in the story; Rain (Cailee Spaeny) has recently completed what amounts to indentured servitude for Weyland-Yutani on an awful mining colony; the same mining colony that killed her parents. However, being evil for evil's sake, Weyland recommissions Rain for active duty, instead of sending her to a promised paradise light-years-away.Following this, Rain is contacted by Tyler (Archie Renaux) and his pregnant girlfriend, Kay (Isabella Merced), who also dream of getting off-world. Their goal is to fly to a seemingly abandoned space station pulled into the planet's orbit - a station made up of two parts; Romulus and Remus. Rain's only friend, a malfunctioning android named Andy (David Jonsson), is an imperative part of this plan, with the ability to communicate with the station's systems, with pilot, Navarro (Aileen Wu) and her boyfriend / Tyler's cousin, Bjorn (Spike Fearn) also being recruited.Rain is told the plan is essentially fool proof. As the audience of an Alien film, we know this is anything but true. That said, Alien Romulus is often, annoyingly, hitting you over the head with over-used nostalgia. Example dialogue includes 'I can't lie about your odds, but you have my sympathies', or 'I prefer the term artificial person' and even 'get away from her you b****'. These however, never hit with the same force as the originals, and feel like the film is trying to capture something that is unreachable.With that in mind, a lot of the original dialogue is...meh (and ham-fisting in nostalgia makes it worse). During the film's first act, I occasionally wanted to throw myself out an airlock just to escape from it - things do improve, but the issue also stems from the characters.Although Jonsson's portrayal of Andy is perhaps one of the most endearing parts of the film - an android who begins to experience an inner conflict when his firmware is upgraded, putting his desire to complete the mission and his wish to keep Rain safe in jeopardy - most of the characters are just single-minded and selfish.The initial goal is unanimously 'get off planet' before later becoming 'get off station'. Though some characters, like Bjorn and his hatred of androids, have minor detail, this is a good idea that is never utilized to its full. I mean, maybe Bjorn could have his negative biases tested, which opens a redemptive ark? Nah!As for the film itself, it's structured less like a typical movie, and more like a song, with three verses (or acts), followed by a shorter bridge at the end. Although the ingredients for the 'bridge' are hinted at earlier in the film, the feature feels bloated because of it. The movie seemingly ends as the third act wraps up, only to shoehorn in more footage, ending on a note that tries to mirror the impressive ending of previous Alien films, only to severely over-reach.Despite this criticism, another area of praise is the set design, which is truly on point, taking visual guidance from the original film, and feeling like a continuation of the Nostromo. The technology is often fabulously inspired by the '70s view of the future, which maintains the series' look and feel. At least until we get to the laboratories, which seem a bit too (subjectively) clean and hi-tech.But on that subject, it is the mystery of what the Romulus was working on; and what happened to its crew, that is the most successful part of the narrative, and really hooks you. It is here that the story from the unfinished Prometheus trilogy is alluded to, which adds surprising and refreshing ideas, that don't always receive the development they deserve.Moving on, the effects for the alien are...good - when you *can* see it, and though I am all for a 'less is more' approach, we all know what this monster looks like by now, right? And seeing the Alien in its 21st century, top of the line graphics, was a big desire of mine, that largely went unfulfilled. Hell, you see more of the alien in the original two films. As an aside (and I don't want to look like a gore-hound), I didn't think the film challenged the brutality of previous Alien films, instead seeming a bit tame in comparison, with say, Alien 3 or Alien Covenant.Additionally, the face-hugger design is not bad (when moving), but when stationary, looks a bit too much like a prosthetic (for my taste at least). However, do not get me started on the acid ~ the utter destruction caused by the alien's blood is truly impressive, as is the digitalisation of a former series character - do you recall Moff Tarkin's appearance in Rogue One? Alien Romulus does something similar here, with spectacular results.Returning to my love affair with the film's diegetic sound, which significantly aids in ratcheting up the claustrophobic tension, this is sometimes hampered by the editing. If the film ever cuts away from a character, to frame them from the perspective of another room, the magic of the atmosphere is inadvertently hampered by the sudden change in, what is often, less disturbing sound, breaking the immersion.Another unfortunate issue is the pacing, which robotically moves from tension to safety, tension to safety, rinse and repeat. It was Quentin Tarantino who likened a film's tension to a stretched rubber-band, and despite having the ingredients for phenomenal tension, the feature seems to have a confidence issue, where it quickly hits the 'take me back to safety' switch just as things are reaching their true intensity. Take one scene, where characters must traverse an obstacle course in zero gravity - one of the film's most taut sequences - only to quickly see the characters reach safety just when things are really becoming breath-taking.In summary, when Alien Romulus is adding to the series formula, not only *can* this often land, but also shows the feature's true potential. It's not helped that the film is often too busy alluding to or downright copying moments from its predecessors, which makes this movie feel like an impersonator, not a true evolution. Alien Romulus will totally be remembered for its amazing sound - but I don't think it will be remembered as one of the top films in this franchise. That crown still goes to the 1979 original and its 1986 sequel.",2024-08-15
67,Xstal,Prophetic & Visionary...,8,"Allegorically, and quite unintentionally, this is the continuing saga of a virus; ignorantly released its only aim is to destroy us, with the wheels reset in motion, it's quest resumes with veined corrosion, a perpetuation that can't be undone, and no where's safe, you cannot run - from the evolutionary transformations, variations and mutations, the prequels, sequels and un-equals, to come - and gone.What's not to like, an intriguing and innovative re-entry into the world of chest busting, face hugging, acid bleeding Xenomorphs, that may have parallels with organisms created in laboratories today, all policed, promoted and protected through intelligence of insincerity too.",2024-09-16

It starts off as the original, but then morphs into the second film aliens. Was it worth the watch yes, are you going to be surprised no. I was hoping for a real horror movie that would keep me on my toes but unfortunately it became predictable, and once it got into the action i found myself unattached to the film. It heavily relied on nostalgia from the first film. Those who loved the original will be seeing things that will remind them of the first film.I really wanted to give this film a 7/10 but unfortunately 6/10 seem better suited.

72,ethanbresnett,A fine addition to the Alien catalogue,8,"It is no easy task to take the helm of such an iconic franchise as Alien and try to bring it back to its stylistic origins, but with Alien: Romulus Fede Alvarez does a brilliant job.Stylistically the film straddles Alien and Aliens, bringing that horror style blended with a more action approach, and it works really well. The plot won't have you scratching your head and pondering unanswerable questions like Prometheus, which may be a good or bad thing depending on what you want from your Alien films. Instead it is more akin to the contained and focused plot of the original, which I really enjoyed.Alvarez manages to create a really strong atmosphere of horror and suspense, with some standout scenes that are truly disturbing, exhilarating and creative. The xenomorph and facehuggers are used just the right amount to get the sense that they are a constant and lurking threat, but not overused to the point they lose impact.Another great success of this film is how sci-fi it feels. The design of the ships, the interiors of the space station, the costuming etc are all really well done. The sound design is terrific too and really contributes to the atmosphere.The characters are perhaps a little too one dimensional aside from Rain and Andy. It is no coincidence then that these are where the two best performances are. Cailee Spaeny is going from hit to hit lately and she is rightly the MVP of this film. David Jonsson is pitch perfect as Andy and has probably the meatiest and most interesting role to play. The supporting characters lack depth but the performances all hold up well.I think the only significant blight on this film is the AI / CG recreation of Ian Holm which is rather monstrous. Whatever your moral standpoint on the use of deceased actors, it just isn't even well done from a technical perspective with the face just not calibrated to body very well at times. Considering the fact that a living actor could have been used with zero detriment to the plot or the impact makes this even more of a bizarre misstep.Putting this aside, Alien: Romulus is a resounding success. It delivers exactly what I wanted from an Alien film. It is atmospheric, disturbing, exciting, suspenseful, and just a whole lot of fun. It looks good, sounds good, and just feels right.",2024-08-21
73,rigby-90667,Looks like something new but not at all,7,"Visually, Romulus is a 10/10. I really enjoyed the movie, but by the end, I was left with a bitter taste in my mouth. It feels like a reboot aimed at a new generation, which left me a bit disappointed. I wanted to know more about David 8 and his story. Also, the entire cast is very young. I understand they want to attract a younger audience, but I didn't see that reflected in the cinema in Buenos Aires, Argentina. While Alien: Romulus is great for those who haven't seen any previous films, it's a shame it doesn't follow the story of Alien: Prometheus or Alien: Covenant, only making some references.",2024-08-16
74,waltermwilliams,What Walt's Watching,8,"Houston I have so many problems, but very few with the new Facehuggers film.Finally the wait is over and the 7 year gap between ""Alien"" and its sequel ""Aliens"" has middle ground that we've been needing to see in cinemas for over 40 years.This movie also marks 7 years since the eighth film, ""Alien: Covenant"".""Alien: Romulus"" feeds on the entire ""Alien"" franchise in a beautifully, horrifying, poetic, Xenomorph way.The trailer initially concerned me that it was going to be a dumbed down, younger generation version of the classics, but once you're on the abandoned Space Station it immediately settles into the rhythm of what ""Alien"" fans demand from Producer Ridley Scott's Scott Free Productions and friends.Space scavengers (including ""Civil War's"" Cailee Spaeny as ""Rain"") suddenly regret docking onto this giant hull when they come literally face to face with one of the most terrifying creatures in the filmic universe and then they are hunted down.BTW David Jonsson as ""Andy"" is outstanding in his duality despite his shocking Dad Jokes.While Isabela Merced as ""Kay"" has one of the goriest scenes in the film.That is if you can try and overlook what happens to ""Navarro"" (Aileen Wu) in a slow motion version of John Hurts demise in the OG.""Alien: Romulus"" leans into a more sexual relationship between Aliens and humans, but you would expect that from the director of ""Don't Breathe"", even though there are no turkey basters.""Evil Dead"" Director Fede Alvarez had his work cut out for him, but he got a helping hand on the script from James Cameron so it fits seamlessly into the ""Alien"" universe (streaming on Disney +).Watch out for: one of the world's greatest actors brought back to life, even though he's been dead for 4 years and listen out for an iconic ""Ripley"" quote.""Alien"" fans will have everything they want from spectacular production design to incredulous special effects and breathtaking zero gravity to storyline and then some in ""Alien: Romulus"".The sheer horror and thriller elements of this franchise ooze like acidic alien drool into every creepy element of this movie as ""Alien: Romulus"" goes back to the basics that has made this series of films so successful for 45 glorious years since we first heard the phrase, ""in space no one can hear you...scream!""",2024-08-15
75,xxxxxdarkmoon,"It reminds me of DOOM 3 the ego-shooter, in the way it looks, but ....",6,"Anyone who has played DOOM 3 will know, what a great opportunity such an abandoned military environment can be to create a perfect horror atmosphere. Claustrophobic and dark. Doom 3 scares the hell out of the player with its atmosphere.I don't know how they did it, but that is NOT the case in Alien: Romulus. Even if it looks very similar to the futuristic facilities on Mars in Doom 3. I wasn't scared once in Alien Romulus.There are jump scares, sure... but jump scares are the cheapest way to get the viewer's adrenaline.Alien: Romulus has some good scenes though, it is like a science fiction action thriller. But the action is just running away from the Xenomorphs. Nothing new to see here.The prequels, Prometheus and Covenant were innovative and had a story behind it. Both prequels had epic images, great atmospheres, and outstanding actors. Just one example for Prometheus: remember the fight scene inside of the escape drone at the end of the movie. When that big guy of the alien race (humanoid-looking big guys) had a death fight against a large parasitoid alien thing with tentacles like an octopus. The alien guy lost that fight when a tentacle entered his mouth. What an epic scene.The best CGI parts of Romulus are the space scenes, especially a collision with a planetary ring. But the visuals of the 2 previous films remain unmatched - sorry. Besides the actors: Charlize Theron, Guy Pearce, Logan Marshal Green, Michael Fassbender, Sean Harris and more.It's beyond me how some people consider Romulus even as the best movie of the franchise besides the original Alien and rate it 9 or 10 stars.",2024-08-28
76,cf-81658,"IMO, best one since James Cameron's Aliens.",8,"This movie was an amazing cinema experience! The movie itself is visually beautiful. With amazing sets and style. The effects are great. Fede Alvarez's decision to use mainly practical effects throughout is really cool. They went all out with the effects. The characters are really good. The movie gives you time to learn and actually care about these set of characters before the action with the Xenomorphs. Each actor gives a pretty decent and believable role. It's just a dang good movie. The 3rd act is insane, and don't go looking for spoilers online, it is better to be seen for the first time in a cinema. The movie also perfectly ties with the original and the prequels. Overall, 8/10 in my opinion. An enjoyable movie/",2024-08-31
77,iamianiman,I LOVE this film as much as Facehuggers love latching onto us!,7,"Alien: Romulus demonstrates that exceptional body horror and slasher films can still be crafted today. Sometimes, all it takes is a return to basics, honoring the film's traditions while introducing fresh elements for the audience, reminiscent of the original. This film serves as a requel to the classic Alien and stands as the best installment since James Cameron's Aliens.The gore in this film is outstanding. It's bloody, brutal, and features scenes that feel fresh and innovative. Even as devoted fans of body horror and slasher films, we found ourselves both disgusted and taken aback by some of the creative choices made. What we truly appreciate is how the director and creative team have studied this franchise; they clearly understood their assignment regarding these gruesome elements. Many filmmakers might have opted for gore purely for shock value, without considering its appropriateness for each scene. However, Alien: Romulus ensures that every moment of gore embodies the Alien identity, showcasing creativity while remaining true to the aliens' method of slaughtering their victims-not merely for bloodshed's sake.Let's be honest: when it was revealed that this film would include an android, our initial thought was, ""Oh, here we go again."" We found it somewhat disappointing that every Alien film feels the need to feature an android. However, as the story progressed, we noticed significant effort put into developing this character. This isn't just ""another"" android; it grapples with the complexities of existential crises, morality, and the blurred lines between good and evil. We appreciate the human side of this new android, so kudos to the screenwriters for their creativity.Additionally, we have a group of teenagers who largely make sensible decisions and avoid the typical rookie mistakes seen in many horror films. Watching them with the understanding that they are unaware of their cinematic reality-and thus oblivious to what's coming-enhances the experience. These characters are notably more competent than those in other slasher films, such as Evil Dead (2013), I Know What You Did Last Summer, or Texas Chainsaw Massacre. It's refreshing to see the scriptwriters acknowledge this trope and actively work to minimize it. While there are still some questionable choices, they stem largely from desperation, which we can overlook.The visual effects are truly remarkable. If you think Dune Part Two will easily claim the Oscar for Best Visual Effects next year, think again-Alien: Romulus could very well take that honor! Not only are the visuals stunningly realistic, but they also evoke a sense of beauty. The vastness of outer space is portrayed with breathtaking detail, allowing viewers to almost feel the texture of the visuals.When not relying on VFX, the filmmakers opted for physical sets, miniatures, and practical effects, including animatronics to bring the aliens to life. This choice pays homage to the traditions of older films, where less CGI translates to a more effective horror experience. The decision to prioritize practical effects enhances the overall realism, amplifying the sense of dread and contributing significantly to the film's ominous atmosphere.However, Alien: Romulus could have benefited from a broader cast. The limited number of main and supporting characters presents a challenge, as the film prioritizes a rollercoaster of fear and gore over storytelling. It leans more towards a haunted-house experience than a narrative-driven one. To maximize the impact of this approach, we believe adding two to three more characters would have enriched the film. For instance, Prometheus was engaging partly due to its diverse cast, which added depth and raised the stakes.While Alien: Romulus may lack substantial storytelling, it compensates with strong character interactions. The chemistry among the cast is commendable, with each actor effectively fulfilling their roles. Their performances evoke genuine emotions-fear, anxiety, curiosity-that amplify the sense of dread. The cast's ability to convey these emotions enhances the film's overall impact.Alien: Romulus proudly embraces its origins and remains true to its artistic vision and identity. However, as a complete product, it falls short of the creative ingenuity needed to expand the franchise. While it demonstrates cleverness, it lacks the inventiveness that could elevate it further. Though there are some fresh aspects, especially in the final act, the film still feels like it's holding back from reaching its full potential. With a bit more originality, this film could have been a truly bloody masterpiece!Verdict: Alien: Romulus is tantalizingly close to achieving masterpiece status in its genre. It masterfully blends nostalgic homage with fresh horror, delivering brutal gore, strong character dynamics, and breathtaking visuals. While it honors the franchise's roots, it falls a tad short in storytelling and innovation. With a few more risks, it could have been a modern classic, but it remains an impressive and terrifying ride - definitely a must-watch in IMAX or 4DX!",2024-08-15
78,MovieCriticOnline,Alien: Teenage takeover,1,"Alien: Teenage takeover. This was a complete and utter waste of time. Let's be honest, Alien is a master piece and Aliens was a great follow up, both still hold up today, the former being the superior version. However, since then there has not been a single Alien franchise movie that came anywhere close to those two classics and the newest installment is no exception.I didn't buy any of it from the beginning. A bunch of teenagers with no commanding screen presence is hard to swallow.The derivative storyline, which has now been recycled way too many times didn't hold up either. And the constant nods to the original and its sequel didn't fare well either. So sad to see Hollywood keep spending all this money with no originality.The cast was just abysmal. None of them could come close to the original cast like Sigourney Weaver, John Hurt, Harry Dean Staton etc, nor the sequel, like Bill Paxton, Lance Henriksen, Michael Biehn etc.Not the actors fault, so the blame goes to the director, studio and producer. SKIP THIS QUICK!",2024-10-24
79,aweynand96,"Humans go through many emotional stages before accepting the coldest, hardest path",7,"Generally, there are two camps of hardcore Alien fans. In one camp are the folks who would rather the franchise stick to its roots and deliver claustrophobic, focused horror - more of the slasher we got in 1979. In the other are fans pushing for the exploration of all this xenomorph business, eager to see where Prometheus and Covenant were headed. Ironically I think Ridley Scott intended to accomplish both. But there's also a third, lazier camp - the one I fall in - made up of fans who just want more aliens, no matter how they're packaged. For this installment, Fede Alvarez leans into the spirit of the original Alien; he flirts with the grander sci-fi implications but he's clearly more interested in what made the first one iconic.Fede is like a master carpenter. He's got all these gadgets, doohickeys and knick-knacks at his disposal, and he's very clever in using each of them. He did his homework; inside his toolbox is a grab-bag of acid blood, pulse rifles, morally ambiguous AI, space stations, a compendium of traumatizing monsters and numerous other things you can point to and go ""ooh"" or ""I know that thing"". Romulus is littered with Chekhov's guns that are so obviously going to go off, but Fede and the filmmakers' love for the material is infectious to the point that I didn't care: I was having too much fun. There is an abundance of creativity applied to familiar Alien-type things, and these are peppered with fresh concepts that are genuinely exciting.But more important, to me at least, is the setting. There's been six Alien movies - I love them all, but some more than others - that all share an affinity for uniquely sci-fi playgrounds for people to get killed in. The Nostromo set the tone and from her greatness spawned uncanny, desolate planets, prison colonies and dead alien spacecraft (all of which provide for marvelous deaths). In Romulus, people are killed on an abandoned space station on a collision course with an asteroid belt. This is an absolutely stunning backdrop, the likes of which I really haven't seen in other films set in space, horror or otherwise. The rendering of the asteroid belt alone rivaled anything I saw in Interstellar. Within the station Fede has crafted what looks, sounds, and feels authentically Alien, pulsing to a score that is mostly familiar, though I couldn't always tell where James Horner ended and something new began.The things I didn't like about Romulus almost entirely concern the cast and writing, along with some odd decisions here and there. There isn't much to say about the six explorers - they do a fine job being scared, looking cool in space, and dying in sickening ways (oops). The character of Bjorn is completely unintelligible. They all do predictably dumb things at different times. There's the decision to include a certain familiar android, who I don't think mattered for the story as much as he did a comically evil, ominous ghoul who jaws at the humans. I am personally not compelled by the human-android relationships, as there was nothing really new explored here, although they could have. Groan-worthy lines, such as shoehorning in Ripley's famous ""GET AWAY FROM HER"" command, neuters the otherwise tense and suffocating mood.It doesn't feel right to end on Romulus's shortcomings, so instead I'll reiterate what is done best: the horror. I didn't just jump, but moaned, whimpered and cringed at the onslaught of awful things that happened on screen. Facehuggers were the standout star to me. They are already disgusting mashups of snakes, spiders, and warped genitalia - I mean really, that's enough. But here they are taken further, both in hordes and as individuals, to creep, stalk, and penetrate the cast (sorry). They've never looked better, or scarier, and neither have the xenomorphs. Forty-five years ago H. R. Giger crafted the most terrifying life force in the universe; they unquestionably still are. To this end Fede deserves enormous credit.6.5/10 for the gall to make that one violating facehugger scene.",2024-08-22

81,user-854-127182,How to ruin such a classic,7,"I am a huge Ridley Scott fan. The original *Alien* is close to the top of the list as a favorite. I have waited a long time for *Romulus*! But this! How could you ruin such a classic?!From the moment the film began, it was clear that something was off. The actors seemed disinterested, delivering flat and uninspired performances that lacked any of the tension or depth we've come to expect from an *Alien* movie. Their portrayals were so disconnected that it felt like they were simply going through the motions, completely out of touch with the gravity of the situation their characters were supposed to be in.The storyline, too, was a complete mess.Ridley Scott's original *Alien* was a masterclass in suspense and atmosphere, but *Romulus* feels like a hollow shell of its predecessor. The narrative choices were baffling, introducing elements that not only felt out of place but also undermined the very essence of what made *Alien* a classic. It's as if the creators forgot what made the franchise work in the first place.In the end, *Romulus* was a massive disappointment. It strayed too far from the roots of the original, leaving behind a film that lacked the soul and intensity that made *Alien* a masterpiece. As a long-time fan, I couldn't help but feel let down by this lackluster attempt to continue the legacy of one of the greatest sci-fi horror films of all time.",2024-08-21
82,eddie_baggins,An Alien film worthy of it's name brand,8,"After years of disappointment for Alien fans that began all the way back in 1992 with Alien 3 and included recent duds Prometheus and Covenant, you'd be right to be cautious about looking forward to the latest addition in the long-standing horror/sci-fi series, Alien: Romulus.While in many regards and aspects sticking close to the Alien formula that Ridley Scott created with his genre defining 1979 original, director Fede Alvarez's old school approach to his source material and ability to craft interesting human/non-human characters makes this new entry into the Alien series one of the surprise success stories of 2024.Honing his craft with the unexpectedly good Evil Dead remake and finding commercial success with Don't Breathe, Alvarez appeared on paper to be a solid choice of director to try and give the Alien cinematic universe a well-needed boost and by milking every cent of his films reported $80 million dollar budget, Alvarez has created a living, breathing and atmospheric offering that provides a wonderfully cinematic experience that is deserving of the big screen treatment.Giving his film a chance to solidly establish itself in the first act, with a very Blade Runner feeling jumping off point on a remote mining colony and then some nice character beats where we are introduced to Cailee Spaeny's (continuing on her fine breakout 2024) Rain and her artificial offsider Andy, played by Rye Lane breakout star David Jonsson, Romulus doesn't rush proceedings as we take in all the elaborate sets and world building that is enhanced by Benjamin Wallfisch's noteworthy score, Galo Olivares camera work and Naaman Marshall's production design.The film's relatively quiet start is reminiscent of its 1979 forefather as is the films intense and full force nature that comes into play when Rain, Andy and their compatriots discover that their quest to utilise a seemingly abandoned old space station may not in fact be the simple and bloodless affair they initially hoped for.The ride Romulus's characters and audiences go on throughout its eventful two hour runtime is one that's best left discovered by those watching without delving into in depth, as unfortunately some critics have already done in the hours after the films official release and while there's going to be some fairly divisive opinions around some inclusion of past lore and happenings and a wild final act that really goes for broke, there's no denying that this is an Alien experience that covers all bases you would expect to be visited from this name brand property.A refreshingly gritty genre mash-up that prioritises the practical over the convenient and an experience enhanced by two noteworthy central turns and a director whose love for the name is clear to see, Romulus may not be a new classic but its a classy and wildly fun thrill ride that showcases there's life still left in the face-hugging world of zenomorphs and chest bursting.Final Say -A hugely enjoyable and well-made new Alien event that may be familiar but at the same time fresh and exciting, Alien: Romulus is a fine new entry into the brand that can sit up there just below Alien and Aliens.4 pairs of Reeboks out of 5Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)",2024-08-16

Alien 3 assembly cut (this film is good!)Going into this film I was so hyped! After seeing reviews off certain sites and some YouTubers I was convinced I was going to be the same but there was some things that never clicked for me.The first half of the film I loved, I really thought this was heading in the right direction then a cgi character turned up then the film took a sharp nosedive! I don't understand the need to have had this character in the film after the different droids we've had over the films but then this is this films major flaw! Why do you have to have callbacks to each film, just tell your own story. I don't need to hear that line from aliens, I don't want to hear what was found in Prometheus.And then to top the film off you borrowed something out of Resurrection which everyone hated at the time but seem to be giving a pass to this film!What this film done right was the effects were top notch! Practical effects and real sets are such a blessing to see rather than lifeless cgi, you can see all the budget on screen was a beautiful film!Now the actors, being a London boy had no probs with the accents and all the actors were good.

Alien & Aliens are always going to occupy the 1&2 slots but this is a decent entry to the franchise.It's a character based ensemble piece with a decent set-up and good cast. The look and feel of the film is totally consistent with the originals - Alien still looks great over 40 years on, so if it's not broke why fix it.The first half sets the scene and expands on the universe we know, the second exposes everyone to multiple threats, some expected others more subtle. You can expect the familiar beats, but it does have new things to say within the universe. It expands on ideas from the original 4 movies and from Prometheus and Covenant in the final third. For better or worse some of the ideas from Resurrection get a second chance, but overall the movie is a big success.",2024-08-17
85,qzzbqt,Great until it wasn't,6,"I'll start by saying I have always loved Alien and Aliens, and even enjoyed Alien 3 to a large extent as a standalone. The first Prometheus was ok, but I didn't get on with the second and felt it robbed me of the previously proposed sequel to Aliens involving Biehn et al.I really enjoyed the way Romulus built up. The setting from the beginning was very reminiscent of the original Alien film and I was delighted to see lots of those elements throughout, including facehuggers, xenomorphs and synthetics. I thought it was really well done, so whoever was involved in scenery, lighting, sounds and special effects needs recognition - I really enjoyed those aspects. My only sticking point was I found some of the spinning in space scenes hard to watch as it was like my eyes couldn't quite follow or focus on anything.I wasn't keen on some of the characters and found myself hoping for their demise at times - I just wasn't rooting for them, and I'm not sure if part of my disconnect is because they all seemed so young and brash, or because there really didn't seem to be much character development or backstory offered. It didn't seem like more than 5 minutes between them first being on-screen to them being thrust into the action, so I'd have liked maybe a bit more build-up there - I don't know how much ended up being cut out, because I'm sure there would have been a lot of work put into the characters that didn't seem to make it onto the big screen. I do remember thinking that the actor playing Andy was incredible, and they were probably my favourite character.Most of the film itself was really enjoyable for me, and I even jumped a couple of times. It had that really good edge-of-the-seat or hands-to-the-face feeling, and think it was largely well done. There were certainly a few obvious nods to Alien that I'll not spoil but did make me smile.I wasn't keen on the delivery of a certain one-liner, but I can appreciate its inclusion even if it wasn't how I'd have liked it.But then the last 10 minutes happened and I came away thinking ""WTAF did I just watch?"" The ending just ruined it for me. I won't spoiler it, but a combination of things happened in a very short space of time and I genuinely wish I could erase them from my mind. It took this film from what could have been up there with the original greats and reduced it to a fever dream. I actually fell about laughing when discussing it while leaving the theatre. Again, I won't spoil it but crikey, it felt very clichéd and to me cheapened an otherwise brilliant film by trying to include too many elements all at once.",2024-08-17
86,gator-23,"Derivative, pkot like an Alien person shooter game, laugh out loud cringe monents.",3,"When I saw Prometheus, I said that Ridley Scott was dead to me.Then I forgot that and went to see the last one, and walked out of it and said Ridley Scott is dead to me.I must be a glutton for punishment because I did it again. I saw Romulus.Ridley Scott- you are dead to me... Still.This movie is an ugly mishmash of laugh out loud cringe moments. When we watched Aliens, the action was gripping and drew you in because we cared about the characters. The tension was drawn out, with tangible edge of your seat moments, and well done.With this movie, it broadcasts its intentions and what's going to happen in the action sequences not only from down the block, but it's down the street, past the city limits, and out where all the car dealers are. The script must have read like bad fan fiction.Alien and Aliens made a very good approximation of what living and working in space might be like. In this movie, any attempt at realism on that regard was cringy. Actually laughed out loud had some of the ridiculous sequences. The whole thing played like a first person shooter from 1999.And for all their budget, why couldn't they do better CGI for Ian Holm? I don't think I've ever seen a lazier CGI effort in the last 10 years. He was basically an NPC for this whole video game of a movie. For everything that his character brought to the original, he and his character deserved better.This was 2 hours of my life that I'll never get back.Ridley Scott, you are dead to me.

87,FeastMode,Really awesome with some flaws,7,"With the latest entry in the Alien franchise, Romulus gives us a nice blend of horror and action. As with the previous two movies (Prometheus and Covenant), the sci-fi aspects are done beautifully. There are so many stunning shots and sci-fi candy. It's visually pleasing.There are several intense scenes and jaw-dropping moments. It does a good job creatively using the premise to create unique horror/suspense scenarios. And there's a certain design in here that I will never forget. It's visually haunting.The biggest flaw is the pacing. I also had trouble buying Cailee Spaeny as a leading lady. She looks like a child and doesn't seem to have the screen presence needed to command an audience. And like the previous two movies, the emotional investment is fairly weak. I didn't fully care what happens to the characters.Even with these flaws, I still found Romulus to be an entertaining movie that scratches the itch of both sci-fi and horror.P. S.

Tapping into everything that made the first two films great, and treating their universe with great reverence, this could actually be the best film of the entire franchise and the worthiest of successors.This. This is how it's done. This is what we've been waiting for since 1986.It feels like a true sequel, quite unlike everything else that came post-ALIENS.",2024-08-18
89,arabnikita,Lacks identity,6,"Alien: Romulus (2024)Another entry to one of my favorite film franchises but with it being a Disney production, I had my share of worries despite the seemingly excellent initial reviews. To put it briefly, Alien Romulus feels like a replica of the original masterpiece trying to mimic it's tone, style and to an extent the plot. Unfortunately, while it does nail the audiovisual elements, thanks to modern technology, by relying on the original as a crutch, it fails to create and engaging narrative to make me care for the characters and their fate.In this story, a bunch of teenagers who have had enough with living in a space colony decide to fly to an abandoned orbital station to steal its cryo pods and travel to a different planet. Once they arrive at the station, things go wrong very fast and they find themselves fighting for their survival.Out of the entire crew, the only person I remotely cared about was the android because everyone was on a mission to make the dumbest decisions as if they were in a campy slasher. The 155 cm protagonist looked like a 13 year old girl and when she was running around with a gun as big as her pretending to fight off a massive Xenomorphs, I kept laughing instead of fearing for her survival. Furthermore, the way they have built up the threat of the Aliens only to make them insignificant cannon fodder felt highly illogical.There are certainly nice elements like the use of practical effects and excellent audio design. Sadly, the music felt out of place and the Ian Holm model was distracting as it didn't fit into the style. Some story moments were cool but when fitted into the overall picture they didn't make the film feel complete or impactful. Maybe if you haven't watched Alien in a while it will hit home big time but I often rewatch the original so the nostalgia factor that this movie banks on didn't do much for me..Movieswithoutshmovies on Instagram for honest movie and tv reviews.",2024-08-17
90,bzsbs,"Good, terrifying and a worthy addition",9,"This movie has an incredibly high bar to scale as the redemption of the Alien franchise has been pinned in it. In that vein I would put this movie at 7/10 stars which is an almost an impossible task. As a stand alone movie it is 9/10. While it felt like maybe too was packed into the 2 hour movie, it still pulls off a worthy terrifying addition and is in the top 3 of the franchise. There were many references to the 2 original Alien movies as well as Prometheus, to the point where it might be over the top. But the bottom line there is a fine line to walk with being tasked to continue the legendary franchise and while it may not have always been perfect, it was certainly well done. Others did not like the final 15 minutes but I felt it was terrific horror and fit into the previous films.",2024-08-16
91,parksiet,"Not what I was expecting, but everything I wanted!",9,"Alien: Romulus is a non-stop thrill ride! I genuinely really enjoyed it - it manages to really capture the tone, feel, tension, and atmosphere of the original Alien so well, while also honouring the rest of the films in the franchise - even Prometheus - which made me (a fan of that movie) super happy!Romulus leans heavily into its horror origins to craft a relentless, visceral thrill ride that starts off slowly and increases in intensity until you're left gasping for breath by the end. Devoid of any thematic depth, it incorporates so many winks, nods, and moments of fan service it often feels more like a greatest hits entry than trying to provide anything new or profound. It felt to the Alien franchise like what The Force Awakens or Jurassic World were to their respective franchises. (Note: I love those movies) Still, the grounded performances from Cailee Spaeny and David Jonsson provide just enough emotional weight to keep audiences invested during the slaughter. It's definitely the most straightforward of the franchise.But that doesn't mean the film doesn't have its own merits. Fede Alvarez has outdone himself with this thrilling, suspenseful, gnarly, and most importantly cinematic film! His direction is smart and efficient with some very clever setpieces that put a spin on what we know, the practical creature effects are off-the-hook, and the world-building, or expansion thereof is superb - exquisite and of a piece with Alien and Aliens. It fires on all cylinders, masterfully using the familiar in unfamiliar ways. The film prioritizes thrills over depth, but it works surprisingly well. Romulus' technically deft exterior more than makes up for its slight thematic nature and everything else in between. The film looks visually beautiful (especially in the expanded IMAX ratio), with terrific cinematography and lighting and detailed practical sets. Don't even get me started on the incredible, bone-crushing, machine-like sound design! And those last 20 minutes... wow Alvarez and his team really swung for the fences with an insane 3rd act that I was so pleasantly surprised with! It took a bold risk that won't work for everyone, but I loved the heck out of it. (Prometheus fans will get me) There was one aspect of Romulus that I undoubtedly had issues with (a certain character - you'll know it when you see it), but luckily it didn't detract from my overall enjoyment of the film.Alien: Romulus is a thrilling flex of visceral storytelling with the kind of frights that rattle you to your core. Fede Alvarez combines elements of what made the '79 + '86 films flourish, from eerie stillness to fun twists. I never knew where this film was headed! Not what I was expecting, but everything I wanted! A claustrophobic, chaotic ride, as all Alien films should be! This one rules!",2024-08-16
92,kgprophet,Alien: The Remix,6,"When watching this film, I could not help but compare the approach of the production and tone of this film to Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. That film was lauded for taking fans back to the very original Star Wars movie, in a sense reliving that moment. Here, Alien Romulus borrows heavily from the original Alien, with similar looking interiors, and good old ""Muthur"", the onboard computer. The drawback is that we are subjected to the same list of alien kabuki moments. The face hugger, the hive, the chest burster, and so on. The recent prequels ""Prometheus"" and ""Covenant"" were also structured the same as the original movie. A small crew out in the middle of nowhere comes across an alien lifeform. Obviously the formula works well if it can survive so many sequels.With a big enough budget like this, the movie works as a science fiction film. The story of trying to grab valuable items before an abandoned space station is destroyed by falling into one of Saturn's rings could be an entertaining film on it's own. There is also a version of the popular character ""Data"" from Star Trek The Next Generation. The android in this film acts like a child, but other times performs superhuman feats. He is the most interesting character in this film. The rest of the crew aren't as memorable. Of course our main character is a smart but slender woman, can't mess with the formula.The best scenes are in the trailer, such as the swarm of face huggers chasing down the crew. I like that the film did not rely heavily on digital effects. Except for the creature revealed at the end. I guess that creature was meant to create some kind of awe and fear, but for me it did neither. Still, this take on the Alien franchise is welcome. A different director with a good retro vibe works here. Perhaps a proper angle can be found in a future film where a true Alien invasion on Earth occurs. 6 out of 10.As an experiment, I am including in this review a brief explanation of how I arrived at my rating of 6 out of 10. There are different ways to approach the rating. One is to start with the rating of zero. The film would need to earn it's stars. 1 for acting, 1 for directing, 1 for story, and so on. Another way is start with the rating of 10, and subtract points for the film's flaws. For this film, I will start with a 10 star rating. Minus 1 star for following the tired old Alien formula. Minus 1 star for the forgettable crew. Minus 1 star for a few set pieces that are less than exciting. Minus 1 star basically because it does not transcend the genre like other higher rated science fiction films.",2024-10-16
93,ontheis,Not a minute wasted,10,"Even though some may say it's a bit stretched or slow in the beginning - it's actually one of the least ""boring"" movies in the last few years. The atmosphere is to die for (robot-like inside joke intended).It is very similar to first three movies of the franchise, but it's the most like the first one, which is one of my all time favorite movies. That's why I consider this movie the best sequel to the Alien yet.Yes, it borrows a little bit from every previous movie, but it has a lot of originality. The action is great. The plot is great. But the way it's filmed is probably the best - Fede Alvarez is one of the top 10 horror directors currently. One of the problems I can't call the real problem is that most of the characters are unlikeable, and do some stupid stuff, but that's to be expected.I highly recommend watching this movie in 4D in cinema. It is truly an experience.",2024-08-17
94,mrsazz,High budget movie with weak cast,6,"I am not sure what could have saved this movie for me, but I am particularly annoyed with the casting. The lead girl was no Sigourney Weaver, that's for sure. She would have matched better with Sesame Street or something on Nickelodeon perhaps.The alien CGI and effects were decent enough, at least what you can expect from a $80 million movie, however the story also felt a bit like it was repeating something you have seen many times before.And as usual, I don't feel compatible with the messaging Hollywood always likes to put out. What is the right decision when faced with a dilemma, for instance.I often gauge how captivated by a movie by how long I take to get through it, and this didn't score well in that regard. I was pausing the movie to check socials and news frequently, and once I even forgot I was watching it. But I made it through, so it wasn't horrible.",2024-10-16
95,robertmarvingislason,The genre has been rebooted,9,"No spoilers here, but long story short. I felt like I was watching Alien for the first time. The thrill was constant and I loved most of the characters. Andy was the favorite of my son that was with me. I think he is my favorite as well and should be rewarded and get double salary. :DI actually felt like I was on a rollercoaster, my mouth wide open in disbelieve and excitement.The best of the franchise was used and made so good that I was in awe.It is also crazy well done. Beautyful and you can see that the makers had ambition to do good. It looks like Fede knows a true Alien fan and did his best to acommidate.I give it nine, but that is just because I was not very fond of some of the quotes to the older movies. I think that he should have kept the dialog more original as it was near perfect.Anyway, this flick is going into my collection.Thanks Fede Alvares (my new favorite director) and all of you that made this thing happen. Loved it.",2024-08-16
96,raja_sarkar,Facehuggers,7,"I totally loved Alien Romulus, and I don't think the trailers did justice to the terror and tension the movie delivers!I've always admired Fede Álvarez's work, like Don't Breathe, but with Alien Romulus, he took the liberty of reducing CGI usage and embracing good-old practical effects-animatronics, models, and live-action puppetry-all woven into a tight, horror-centric narrative reminiscent of Ridley Scott's original Alien. Thanks to the excellent collaboration between the Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) team and Legacy Effects, the Xenomorphs in this film are incredibly lifelike and believable. That said, the aliens in the Alien franchise have always been somewhat predictable. They often feature exaggerated slime - sometimes watery gel, other times green goo-and now there's black goo. Trends change, I suppose. But it's a clever choice to always give them a dark, shadowy appearance-saves the trouble of making each one look distinct, a feat that's arguably divine.I liked the name Romulus; it felt like a direct nod to the founder of Rome and colonization, aligning perfectly with the story, which revolves around teenage space colonists inadvertently encountering terrifying hybrid variants of the original Xenomorphs-now referred to as ""Facehuggers."" Interestingly, these versions are all lab-grown! As silly as it may sound, how these Xenos rapidly and consistently identify a human face to ""hug"" remains an unexplained mystery. They do more than just hugging - they insert, and they insert deep! Imagine if variants targeted different human body parts, a ""mis-hugging"" Xeno could earn some hilarious names - fodder for spoofs or memes perhaps, that is if the movie achieves some cult status, which in today's oversaturated market, seems quite unlikely.On another note, I'm curious why so many Hollywood directors choose Hungary for big-budget sci-fi films. Dune (2021), Blade Runner 2049 (2017), and The Martian (2015) were all shot there-probably due to cost efficiency, but who knows? Still, it's impressive that Alien Romulus wrapped filming in just four months!One thing I disliked was the final design of the human-hybrid Xeno. It looked derivative, unthreatening, feeble, and diseased. The scene where it kills its human ""mother"" could have been rethought and executed with more subtlety. Instead, it felt overly repulsive.Despite this, the rest of the movie was excellent. I loved the dark, 80s-inspired color palette and minimal CGI. Fun fact: whenever I watch a thrilling movie, I tend to overindulge in big popcorn combos, nachos, sweet corn, and coffee - but I rarely finish them. With Alien Romulus, though, I polished off everything!""Moviehuggers love Facehuggers""",2024-12-07

I can't say much about the crew because was just kids and they play their part, nothing noticeable. I felt fouled at the end of the movie, so much advertise and positive reviews before and then you found out that is just a low budget film with kids who probably they are payed astronomically less then a medium well known actors , the effects are ok but compare with Interstellar or The Martian they look mediocre taking in consideration that Ridley Scott was involving here. The story is confusing, cheap dialogues, and where are the aliens?

Once it set off, I was gasping every 2 seconds. Even the guy next to me was tapping his knee in suspense.

In fact it makes the fourth movie look almost okay by comparison. There seems to be this idea today that if you have the ability to spend lots of money on sets and special effects, you should use them. It's a mistake. The beauty of the original was the simplicity of the structure, the high level of the cast, and the understanding that the things that make a movie scary is not what you show but what you don't. The original did it all brilliantly, but this reboot misses the mark by always, always doing and showing more. But of course, it's all been set up for the next movie and - yes - in exactly the same way as the original.",2024-12-03
100,jcallows,Sometimes a Little Studio Intervention can be Good,8,"Alien Romulus caught my attention because of the generally positive reviews. But despite this and after so many poor sequels and spin-offs, I came in with low expectations. Turns out, it was pretty good, despite the ending.This was the third best Alien film, behind Aliens and Alien. It accurately captured the atmosphere and mood of those films. The use of both practical and digital effects helped achieve this. Surprisingly, the star of the movie was the android. He was well depicted. Very human-like, yet not quite.I enjoyed this film, except... for the ending. When I saw it, I was surprised the studio had approved it. I later found out they initially didn't but relented. There's a common perception anytime the studio interferes with the director's vision, it can only hurt the final product. But in this case, a little studio intervention would've helped this film.

101,ccttff,A Story That Deserved More Depth,6,"Most teenagers will enjoy the movie, but others may find the story too simplistic, akin to a PS5 game. While it's important for theaters to cultivate a younger audience, a film like Alien should offer more than just the adventure of reckless, and at times, brainless boys and girls. Perhaps I expected too much, but I did appreciate the chilling atmosphere. However, in an era dominated by ChatGPT, the film's AI discussion feels outdated, as if the director is stuck 50 years in the past. It's encouraging to see filmmakers trying to recapture the unique allure of cinema, but I must admit, veteran moviegoers with above-average IQs may increasingly feel that they're either too smart or too old to justify a trip to the theater.",2024-08-26

103,connersklenke,Fantastic return to Alien,9,"Alien: Romulus is a fantastic return to form in the Alien franchise that honors what came before and establishes itself as its own terrifying sequel.I loved this film. It's gross, uncomfortable, atmospheric, intense, and nostalgic. It honored Ridley Scott's original 1979 film by utilizing slow-building tension, unnerving atmosphere, and isolation. This film also used a mixture of beautiful practical and digital effects to create a perfect blend of immersion into the terrifying Romulus spaceship.I can't overstate how good this film looks. The cinematography is gorgeous to watch. The set design felt claustrophobic. The practical effects blended with digital made for a completely immersive experience that keeps you glued to the screen. The pacing is amazing, no drag or rush.The small but memorable cast keeps the film emotionally tight. Cailee Spaeny gave a wonderful performance as Rain, solidifying herself among the great final girls of the Alien franchise. David Jonsson's character, Andy, was my favorite. Despite his character's limitations, he was the most compelling character in the movie. This was due to David's greatly subtle performance that had me invested all the way through. The dynamics between characters worked to help bring the audience further in on their goal and actually made me care about their fate. The dialogue between the cast felt natural and the plot's progression flowed smoothly.The story was simple, yet effective. It was straightforward and didn't bite off more than it can chew.The most surprising element about this film is the way it honored previously established lore and events of other Alien films. As a fan of the franchise, it brought the best shock and smile to my face.Overall, Alien: Romulus is a fantastic sequel that holds the title worthy of being called one of the best Alien films to be released in recent memory.---------------------------------------------------------------------

The cast were lacking in gritty realism; it felt like a B movie played by amateurs. The script was underwhelming and the plot just didn't deliver anything new to the franchise. It was an okay watch but I really expected something better and groundbreaking. If I compare it to Prometheus or Covenant, it is very poor. It just lacked creativity and gripping new concepts. I felt very little emotional connection with any of the characters. They could have better spent the money on a high octane, action, horror, scifi rather than portray the 'do synths have human feelings' narrative with a tedious plot that felt full of cliches.Sorry but it just was average in my humble opinion.

It was hard to take them seriously, it almost seemed they tried to be taken seriously too much.Tough kids with no innate toughness expressed or character acting that would convey real suffering on a mining world.The sentimental robot rehashed for the nth time...This franchise should have got something like the Dune treatment, given to an original director with a powerful artistic vision.

While Prometheus is more my style, Alien Romulus comes is right there in that next tier with alien and aliens. For me, this is the kind of movie I'd prefer to watch from bed because it's packed with constant scares. It plays out like the best horror space sci-fi video game ever made, with a very game-like structure-which isn't a bad thing, but you need to be into that kind of design. The set pieces are fantastic, it's beautifully shot, and the pacing is excellent. The narrative is very simple. Cailee Spaeny is truly a standout-she embodies the ""girl next door"" while also being tough and smart. IMO, she is the best actor for her generation.

I don't want to waste anyone's time, so here it is: according to my taste, the movie deserves a maximum of 6 out of 10, and this 6 is due to the special effects. Otherwise, Alien: Romulus is very far from the emotions of the Alien universe. It fails (nor does it seem to aim) to capture man's awe, fear, hopelessness and resignation before a being majestic in his superiority and evilness. It's just an action movie without any depth.

The cinematography is fantastic, with some excellent shots of space. The practical effects and sets are well executed and utilized, creating a constant edge of your seat thrilling ride. Fede Alvarez does a great job of blending horror, action, and suspense. There is a fascinating use of temperature and gravity that was very well done and I really enjoyed. The score is compelling and creates a thrilling atmosphere all throughout the film. The plot is simple and straightforward, which is perfectly fine and as it should be.The characters are a bit weak at times, as I didn't really connect with some of them emotionally. However, Cailee Spaeny was solid as Rain in the lead role and David Jonsson was exceptional as the synthetic Andy. Their chemistry was felt and their relationship was unique and interesting.Once the film starts to progress and distinguish itself, the fear takes a hold of you and doesn't let you come up for air. It's a fresh, dynamic, and satisfying experience. The Xenomorphs look incredible and are as frightening as we've ever seen them. Overall, Romulus checks all the boxes and delivers as a top entry in the Alien franchise, and probably my personal favorite of the films. Enjoy it!",2024-08-16
110,redbenm,Remember when movie makers cared about you.,2,"The film Alien was released 45 years ago, I highly recommend watching a making of Alien documentary on the Internet. Take note of the way this idea evolved on paper and onto the big screen. From the original draft from Dan O'Bannon through to the director Rodley Scott and his vision realised by the visceral works of H. R Giger.It's a wonder and a priverlage to see how something can form into a piece of art, a cultural phenomenon, a true masterpiece and to realise this can only be achieved by the hard work and careful collaboration of talented people working in unison with one objective, to offer as much entertainment to the paying customer as possible in a genuine way.James Cameron with Aliens was also able to achieve this by taking the lore, respecting it and expanding on it. He was able to switch the genre and add his own ideas without disrespecting the paying customer.I think its important to understand that these movies arnt remembered for how well they did at the box office, but for the memories they gave people and the fans they generated.Alien Romulous for me isn't the 4th best Alien movie, it isn't a homage to the Alien franchise, it isn't giving fans a nostalgic good time by winking at them while regurgitating iconic lines. It's cheap, and it's lazy and with 45 years of experience and knowledge on the original movie it's saddening to see what film makers think of its paying customer.It's an insult. A rating of 7.5 is an insult. Maybe this is the intellect of the 3 second attention span, youtube short watching dimwits who with absent minds attend the theatres these days.It gets a 3 from me.

Alien Resurrection has a cool story, with lot of potential and cool ideas, but the director didn't do a good job. Prometheus and Covenant have their flaws, but at least brought some new ideas. Romulus? It's full of stuff that we already saw in the previous movies, even the lines said by the actors. I don't want to spoil anything, but from the very beginning to the end, it's full of stuff that we already saw in the previous chapters. If you know well the other movies, you'll see. So what is it? An homage? Finally, the fact that very young people, kids in their 20s, will be able to pilot a space ship like a Toyota Corolla it's ridiculous, even for a far future. Unless you are a teenager, will be hard to identify yourself wih these characters. The producers made the same mistake of Resurrection: they gave the job to the wrong guy.

114,basilmckeon,"Great thriller, but could have been exceptional!",8,"If this movie was a new IP and we expected nothing of it, this film might be a 10/10; it is a good thriller with decent pacing (for a thriller, not an Alien movie!) and high quality special effects.However, as an ""Alien"" film that returns to its roots, that is debatable. My main complaints with the movie are that it leans towards action and less towards a slow-burn horror film, and that the station itself does not have an identity beyond a name; there are only a half dozen distinguishable sets on the station itself when there could have been far more scenes of exploration, investigation, hiding, using the environment for advantage, etc. The station has no identity and we aren't given much in terms of scale. When the characters are running through it, it seems like it might be a bit smaller? But later in the film there is an event and it looks like the station is much larger?The movie could easily have been 20 minutes longer, with more character development in the beginning, and more investigation into the space station itself by the salvage crew. Unfortunately all of the characters except for the main two are extremely forgettable, so much so that it's not even clear how our protagonist knows the salvage crew. The lack of character development makes this film more of a monster thriller than a homage to Alien and Aliens where the characters are so unique with thoughtful (and memorable) dialogue and motives.The timeline becomes extremely accelerated early in the film, but this movie (again), easily could have extended its timeline to include multiple days and then included more scenes that paint a picture of real horror inside of a space station that is both vast but constrained by a terrifying creature. Our heroes don't so much outsmart the foe as kind of get lucky.Overall it is the 3rd best Alien film to date, and it's a really great thriller movie that keeps you watching. But as a true art piece with rewatchability, it falls a bit flat. I also have some personal complaints as to the lore of the creature and its lifecycle, let's say illogical and unbelievable biological growth.That said I hope the studio is paying attention that this is more what audiences are hoping for when the world ""Alien"" is attached!",2024-08-19

The final act was a somewhat not in my taste for outcome of the final onscreen xenomorph. I was scoring the film in the 8's until the end and my final score really nose dived but I pulled up and rated it a 7. Somewhere a Halloween horror maze is being erected with the feel of this film. Our two main characters really delivered for me and it was fun to see the return of a certain dooming synthetic brought back to the story and carry the same looming presence. The Company has returned to some harbinger of bad outcome for our crew. I really appreciated the ""space correctness"" with the effects falling out of reality. The visuals were great especially in Dolby. Run time was good and the film did not feel like it was dragging or too short. Kudos on production and editing.",2024-08-17
116,teacherianmitchell,Worth the wait.,8,"Finally, after 30 or so years of waiting, there is an Alien sequel that does the first two films justice.Fede Alvarez has delivered a great example of sci-fi suspense and terror in a well written and well executed addition to the Alien canon.Cailee Spany and David Jonsson hold together a brilliantly written script with two excellent performances. Jonsson, in particular, is fantastic as synthetic human, Andy, showing his range as his character flitters between the bumbling sibling to Spany's Rain and the more sinister being that is deviously updated by the remnant's of Ian Holm's Rook.There are several stand-out sequences, with one in particular that plays with gravity to extraordinary effect. The ending was a partial surprise to me, but I must confess that where I would have perhaps kept things truer to the source material, it made for an ending that certainly kept me guessing.They have, clearly, really tried to stay loyal to the first two movies, and I for one really appreciate it - more like this please!",2024-08-20
117,de_deugniet,Alien Teen Horror,6,"I just saw this movie and I am kind of disappointed. It felt like a mash of all alien movies: to the scenes down to the quotes, which I guess were meant to be wink-wink, but just fell flat. Yes, it is an alien movie so you know what to expect. But still it is possible to create tension, a claustrophobic environment (which I thought we were getting but I didn't get that feeling).The cast is young, which gives it a more horror/slasher/teens in the wood feeling. So you know how that goes.One character I was like: dude why you not moving? The rest of the characters were okay, I guess. Felt they are going down in my memory as the characters of Alien:Resurrection (kinda forgotten).I liked the first 10-20(?) minutes of the movie. TBH I would have liked to see more. Was nice to see the surface of the planet, but that's it.The movie went on a bit too long.",2024-08-15
118,Zapfhaehnchen,A good copy is better than a bad remake,8,"Alien: Romulus is far more convincing than its two previous movies. On the one hand, the film returns to its roots, but also raises new questions for the franchise.To sum it up, more horror elements characterise the movie again and there is a continuous build-up of tension. In particular, there is enough time to fully introduce the characters, but the movie doesn't lose its pace. The first hour of the movie in particular shows us the worldbuilding, the individual characters and gives us an idea of where the story is heading.However, there are two reasons why it's not enough for 10 out of 10 stars:
1) There are some deep-fake CGI effects that, in my opinion, are not well done. That's a shame, because the rest of the animations look fantastic!2) Recurring elements from the previous movies. People who know the old Alien movies will recognise many of the dialogue sequences and scenes, which are (if you know about them) rather clumsily rehashed in this movie.Nevertheless, it must be said that Alien: Romolus is the Alien movie you've been waiting for. Great worldbuilding, a continuous build-up of tension right to the end, fantastic camera work, an oppressive atmosphere and the great retro look make this an absolute must-see movie!",2024-08-29
119,redban02,"Feels like a basic action/horror, offering little we haven't already seen",6,"I think it's just an OK movie, not the spectacular movie that some critics claim.The movie is quite predictable, especially the ending; and I feel some of the character stories are undeveloped. I'm still not entirely sure how our heroine relates to the group that comes up the idea of breaking into the space station (was she just a casual friend/acquaintance? Was she romantically involved with one of the guys?) ... I also think the movie could've done better to convey the characters' urgency of leaving the mining planet. The story of her parents and her relation to the android Andy was also un-explored somewhat. I know the film already runs at 2 hours, so going into these areas might've been too much. But I feel they could have cut out some of the scenes with Rook, who shouldn't have gotten more than a cameo (instead he's portrayed as the top villain at times)The actor who plays Andy gives the best performance. I'm not too thrilled about the protagonist, Rey. I actually wish Isabel Merced had the top billing role infact.Overall, I don't hate the movie, but I didn't find it too memorable or impressive. The film feels more like a standard run-of-the-mill B+ action/horror, with a basic plot and framework that we've all seen many times beforeIt's not as good as Alien or Aliens. But it's better than Alien 3, Covenant, and Resurrection. It might be about the same as Prometheus.6.5/10.",2024-08-16

Too many homages to other films in the series, to the point where they feel like they were shoe horned in, and some inconsistencies creating plot holes really are the difference between this being up there with the first 2 movies and it being a middle of the road entry instead.Still an enjoyable ride for horror and sci-fi fans alike and well worth the price of admission.",2024-08-14
122,georgega_11,Greatest Hits from Previous films executed well - ish,6,"This film, has the ingredients to be great, but it got sucked into the tropes which we have been all to used to in previous franchise entries.I am not going to spoil any of the film, but suffice it to say that you will recognise patterns in the script, dialogue, scenes and cinematography which we have seen all the way from Alien to Covenant (all titles included). It runs like a greatest hits of topes from previous franchise entries and as a fan this was nice, but it was not great.I left the movie feeling like I'd been entertained, but it was not horrific enough, the lore was not delved into and the characters, well behaved like the ones in Covenant (say no more!).Special effects were good and I think there was one 'jump' which surprised me a little bit but the rest were quite predictable and met with just a loud blast of music or sound.The ending was a little clumsy to my taste and nothing new, once you see the setup (which was obviously signalled in an early scene) I was hoping to be pleasantly surprised but it was Alien: by numbers.Why was it called Romulus (I suspect something to do with Ridley Scotts classical background) but we did not discover this which I was hoping for.I enjoyed seeing a character which you will know who I mean when you see the movie, however their face looked rather AI generated (look at the eyes) rather than special effects which we have seen in other movies where a similar technique has been used.Overall the movie was not nearly as menacing, frightening, story driven or filled with enough lore to really get me to want to see it or recommend it. I'm a fan, not a lot got by me, and there were plenty of 'references' little visual queues and copycat scenes which made this more 'Force Awakens' than 'Rogue One' in Star Wars parlance.Visual effects overall were great but without the story and scenes to back these up, you just get a big escape room with a monster... saw it in IMAX and Dolby Atmos and the sound in places was what made it really interesting so kudos to the sound editor. Acting was fine, despite the characters not being capable of feeling any empathy for and a couple quite glad when they inevitably left the movie.Is it worth seeing in the theatre, I think so, unless you have a killer TV and sound setup at home. But don't go thinking you are going to see anything any better than Covenant.",2024-08-15
123,romsicsdavid-61891,Must See Big-Screen Spectacle,8,"This film exceeded my expectations, far surpassing any initial doubts I had. The flashbacks are wonderfully nostalgic, and witnessing the iconic Ian Holm on screen again is truly heartwarming. While the storyline holds up well overall, there are a few narrative gaps, and the pacing feels a bit rushed at times, but these are minor flaws in an otherwise solid film. The performances are exceptional, with Cailee Spaeny and David Johnson delivering standout roles. However, the dialogue occasionally falls flat and could have been more polished.Contrary to some opinions, the CGI is impressive and meets industry standards. This is definitely a movie you need to experience on the big screen.After many years, the Alien franchise has finally been revived with a film that does it justice, and I couldn't be more thrilled. Go see it in theaters, you won't regret it.8.5/10.",2024-08-14
124,masonsaul,Unoriginal but great,8,"Alien: Romulus merges Alien and Aliens to great effect. It doesn't have any original ideas, and the bad de-aging is massively overused, but it's able to successfully compensate for that because of how good it is at crafting unbearably tense set pieces throughout. It's a nasty, IMAX worthy thrill ride that just needed to tone down the amount of callbacks and nostalgia to achieve its full potential.It's a small cast that ranges from being really likeable to dickish with understandable motivation. Cailee Spaeny is a terrific lead whose bravery grows over the course of the film, following the classic Ripley arc in satisfying fashion. David Jonsson is superb as he switches from endearingly unassuming to unnervingly cold with ease and his bond with Spaeny is the heart of the film.Fede Álvarez's direction confirms he was the ideal choice to continue this franchise and he remains gifted when it comes to delivering inventive scares that keep you on your toes. There's some standout zero gravity action and multiple scenes that are nail biting on their own but even stronger when paired with each other. He cleverly makes it feel deceptively tame in its gore for the most part until the end really goes for it.The set design and overall use of practical effects are phenomenal. There's a clear reverence for the original which shows in all the analogue tech and grungy hallways which makes the mostly practical Xenomorphs and face huggers even scarier. Once again, the budget extends far beyond what it actually is in terms of the sense of scale and how impressive the visual effects are.",2024-08-16
125,flare2,Familiar nolstalgia cashgrab,6,"The movie on its own was fairly enjoyable to watch. The cinematography, the effects, the set pieces, the dialogue, everything was on point. If you don't count deepfake Ian Holm, though. Unfortunately all the human characters are bland and uninspired and the android(s) are the best characters of the movie.That said I feel the movie does not deserve a good rating. This was basically a remix of all the other Alien movies with way too many misplaced references and callbacks. Why did we need an android that looks like Ian Holm but is not his orginal character? Because money and nostalgia.Prometheus and Covenant were not good movies but at least they tried something new and tried to expand on the Alien lore. This movie did nothing new, nothing interesting. You will forget it as soon as you leave the theater.If nothing else I hope this film will serve as a stepping stone for David Jonsson. His performance carried this whole thing.",2024-08-19

It was distracting at times.Great job on the alien. CGI was good. And the story was ok at best. The usual pandering and rhetoric was shoveled into the script, and frankly that garbage is getting old. Disney seriously needs to lay off already.19% of the cast share their gender identity and or preferred pronouns in their bios. So that annoyed me, BUT it falls below my 20% tolerable threshold. It's just a huge red flag when I see that ridiculous information shared. I don't even bother watching anything these days if that threshold is broken. Ive had my fill of weak people and political pandering. They Lose all credibility instantly in my eyes.

The main two leads also did a very good job and added to the story.The director also takes steps to ensure we feel that we are in this universe. From the same technology style to references to things we've seen or heard mentioned in other movies it does a nice job of grounding the movie in a universe so many enjoy.This is clearly the best movie in the franchise since 'Aliens' and a must for fans of the series.",2024-08-16
128,florianvanhorenbeek,Bring back lifeform.,8,"Since I've been banned by the brats from AVP-Galaxy for absolutely false and absurd reasons I thought I'd post my review here.It's been a couple of days since I have seen Romulus and I had a good feeling going in and left the theatre feeling really satisfied. My worst fear that the production value was going to be sub-par because Romulus originally was meant to be a movie for streaming services has officially been debunked big time.It's without a doubt the best movie since the original Trilogy, hands down. I loved the premise of Prometheus for being epic and explore more of the lore and Alien-universe but hated it in the end because it didn't deliver and eventually fell flat on it's face. This take on the franchise plays it relatively safe, which is fine, but it excells in the execution of all of it. I believe this is going to age well because of the use of practical effects and actual sets. Way better than like for instance Avatar, where the director relies on green screens 90 percent of the time.First of all, It looks gorgeous. We get some very well designed sets with a lot of attention to detail and some really neat vehicles as well. If you liked the retro-style computers, the white-wall living quarters or the claustropbobic corridors seen in the original, you are definitely going to dig this. It's truly a hommage to ALIEN and everything that followed. The practical effects knock it out of the park and it's being complemented by really high-standard CGI. I admit it looks quirky at times when it comes to facial expressions on some characters but it's not so bad that it takes you out of the experience completely. I would even dare to go say this looks even better than Dune at times. It's truly in a class of it's own because you don't really have anything to compare it to these days, except the original. So 5 stars for the visuals. They absolutely nailed it. It's a rare gem, especially these daysThe music and sound design is also very good, with nods to the original Trilogy every turn. We get the absolute silence in space, the heartbeat rush when a character gets facehugged, and the nostalgic bleeps and bloops from the aged computers. A real treat to be honest.They dropped the ball sometimes when it comes to the characters and acting. Most of them are forgettable and don't really have an impact on the main storyline. They're just there as cannon fodder. Aside from the main character and its sidekick it's really hard to remember any of the names. Also noticed some very questionable decision-making near the end. But not nearly as bad as in Prometheus where a guy wants to pet an obviously pissed, possibly venomous alien snake. The acting isn't up to standard all of the time but then again, it's not that bad that it can't be overlooked. It's pretty solid overall even though the cast is far younger and less experienced than any of the previous entries. All in all, they did a good job and should be brought up for a bonus-situation.However, what will stirr controversy without a doubt is the final 20 minutes or so. I was fine up untill then, really having a great time but the final act mostly took elements from the lesser movies of the franchise and let it down in some way. I hate Alien humanoids in any way, shape or form because it just feels lazy. The narrative was stolen from Netflix's Titan and felt repetitive. Luckily it was such a blast up till then that I didn't really care anymore. If you don't like the ending, just skip it.So final thoughts:Omg, this is the first real Alien-movie in decades that makes me proud for being a life-long fan. Even though the aliens don't scare me anymore like the one in Alien 3 when I was a toddler, it does most of the crucial things absolutely right. The atmosphere, the props, the sets, the Easter eggs everywhere, the references to mythology, the nostalgic sounds, the body horror, the new stages in the Alien life-cycle. It's all been done with a lot of love for the franchise and I couldn't be any happier considering all the triple that is coming from Hollywood these days. It's solid, it looks and sounds awesome and even though it doesn't have a Ripley cameo or true expansion of the lore going for it, it's more than decent enough to warrant a sequel and I think it will age really well. It's above all a revive of a tired franchise and return to form, leaving all the bloated and pompous elements from the last movies out of it!It's simple and straight-forward and that's where it gets most of it's charm from. I am so pleased the franchise is back on track and can't wait for the next movie!Pass me some cornbread pls and lets ROCK!!Snake

129,Quackser,Children's movie,1,"I had read reports that this version was close to the original format and was looking forward to watching an edge of seat story set in the future.Unfortunately, it has child actors rather than adults portraying 'the crew' so expectations sunk immediately. I mean, how can you compare the crew of the original 'Alien' to the new group of teenage nobodies that can't act nor talk coherently?How can you take a movie like Alien and swap the characters for teenagers and expect it to be none other than made for an audience who likes Transformers or the latest Marvel nonsense? For me, it was a wasted opportunity to utilise modern day sets, effects & action and recreate the tense atmosphere of the original movie. I should have known it would be an impossible quest. The young man who 'speaks' with an English/London accent was particularly annoying - he should've been a ventriloquist as anything he said was complete and utter gibberish.I really can't believe Ridley Scott threw away his legacy to put his name to being 'producer' for this production - he has either lost the plot or, they paid him millions.Anyway - if you're aged 13-17 and like putting your head in a backstreet overfilled rubbish bin - you'll love it.

130,filmtravel101,Bad script and no tension/horror or shock - poor remake,6,I was excited to see this film even if no real A listers as the CGI looked good in the trailersUnfortunately this film starts off with decent plot with a group of teen actors that quickly devolves into video game mode Doom player mode where there is really no sense of tension or fear of the Aliens.It gets even funnier where they blast the Aliens in zero gravity and decide to play silly slide through the acid goo. And forget about all the prior movie dialogue rip offs but the film borders on stupidity on the characters actions which mostly involves just lots of closing air lock doors in the nick of time.The finale is waft of the most cringe worthy moments where one really wonders what inspired the Creature from the black lagoon mating with Prometheus ha haAt one point so many people in the theatre were either laughing or bored looking at their phones because there was no tension or intensity in the story and way too predictable - unlike all other Alien films - this one almost gave away all plots and only was missing Captions for the IQ impaired.The CGI and cool video games might entice some to think it's cool yet I found it to be mediocre and definitely not a memorable sequel that could have remained on the shelfPlease bring back James Cameron to liven up the next one6 stars.,2024-08-21

It pays homage to old films with respect and care for the fan base, carefully avoiding offending anyone. The sound design is freakishly superb, and the animatronics and VFX teams did an even better job. The jump scares are well-timed and effective, but not overwhelming. There's a little bit of tasteful gore, but it's not too much or nauseating. The movie has nice twists and surprises, and it never goes off the rails-it sticks to the old format that the first film had.It was a nice movie to watch in the cinema.I think if I could turn back time and watch this movie instead of Alien (1979), I probably wouldn't have slept for days, just like when I saw the old one.",2024-08-14

133,shakercoola,"Pulls the same levers, but there is pleasing variation in the recurring motifs",6,"An American sci-fi thriller horror; A story about a group of downtrodden young space colonists, in pursuit of better life conditions who encounter extreme hostility while scavenging a derelict space station. This seventh installment has verve, and the backstory to the characters seems plausible. The set design was a style borrowed from the first two films for this 'legacyquel'. It reproduced the same lived-in effect and visceral aspect. Other callbacks to past films, like recurring tropes, are reimagined to pleasing effect, while some of the gunfights and repeated one-liners, and a character resurrection, land garishly. Other visual effects, like the distant planet system and a depiction of an asteroid belt are mesmerising. The pace works, and early scenes of exposition are interesting, but they don't lead to anything surprising in the plot; it is a fairly formulaic trapped-in-a-spaceship chase flick. There is the odd gripping moment, but no feeling of dread; the aliens don't elicit much fear, only disgust in some scenes of startling gore. Cailee Spaeny eschewed the kind of histrionics often employed with playing a lead in a film like this, and was convincing as a blue-collar space miner and her relationship with a synthetic human 'brother.' David Jonsson was a good match for her in his dynamic part too, though his line delivery lacked enunciation in some of his longer scenes. As an aside, something may have been lost in the ambition to develop more mature ideas, as with previous installments, and thought-provoking questions about AI-human interaction are unexplored, but the younger cast gives the franchise a well-needed shot in the arm for loyal fans of the 'Alien' series.",2024-08-21

In fact, the original ""Alien"" directed by the amazing Ridley Scott was one of several unforgettable movies that began my early obsession with filmmaking. So, as a lifetime Xenomorph lover, and alien movie enthusiast in general, I thoroughly loved this entry.I have seen every single film more times than I can even count and can practically quote Alien and Aliens respectively.The franchise has had some moderate wins and undeniable misses throughout the decades (I don't even count the Alien vs Predator movies as cannon). But this movie has virtually everything that I wanted from a good quality Alien chapter. Admittedly there were one or two cringe dialogue moments, but other than that, I was impressed by the simplicity and attention to detail that went into everything presented here.There was just enough nostalgia thrown in to wet my appetite and a nod to the extended universe to make me smile (no spoilers of course).The acting was really good, and the visuals were even better. Special shoutout to having the filmmakers choose practical effects over CGI (wherever possible of course).

135,moviemanager,"It could have been better, but still an okay movie.",6,"The iconic film ""Alien,"" released in 1979, serves as a significant reference point for this upcoming movie. This cinematic endeavor remains faithful to the original timeline, which is a commendable decision. Prior to its release, ""Alien: Romulus"" generated a substantial amount of anticipation, potentially due to its ambitious scope. The cast predominantly features lesser-known actors, with Cailee Spaeny, the lead performer, demonstrating promising potential for future stardom. The movie commences with a promising start, effectively capturing the essence of the ""Alien"" franchise. However, it does take some time to gain momentum, resulting in a slightly sluggish beginning.Some CGI elements are incorporated into the film, occasionally drawing attention in a less than ideal manner. Nonetheless, there are numerous visually stunning moments, particularly in the depiction of space. While I do not find the movie particularly frightening, I believe this may be due to my understanding of its connection to the origins of Alien.However, there is a notable weakness that impacts my overall perception of the film. In my opinion, a certain aspect does not fully succeed and appears to be a hastily devised solution. I would have preferred a slightly different plot structure. For some reason I experienced similar emotions to those I felt when watching Alien: Resurrection. Overall, I would describe the movie as satisfactory, although it falls short of my expectations. It is a solid film that effectively utilizes its new cast. Perhaps I have yet to fully grasp the broader context.

137,MarkYEG,"""Alien: Romulus"" - A Nostalgic Dive into the Alien Universe",7,"Watching ""Alien: Romulus"" in a nearly empty theater, with only eight other people sharing the space, turned out to be a intimate experience for a film that thrives on tension and isolation. This setting allowed for an immersive dive into Fede Álvarez's latest addition to the Alien franchise, which, much to my joy, felt like a love letter to the original trilogy's essence.""Alien: Romulus"" doesn't just nod to its predecessors; it embraces them with open arms. The film captures the claustrophobic horror of the original ""Alien,"" the relentless action of ""Aliens,"" and even some of the thematic depth of ""Alien 3,"" albeit with Álvarez's distinct flair. The movie's atmosphere, from its dimly lit, industrial, vintage tech settings to the eerie silence punctuated by sudden, heart-stopping scares, evokes a strong sense of nostalgia. The design of the alien creatures, the use of practical effects, and even the sound design pay homage to what made the original films so memorable. Yet, it's not just about nostalgia; Álvarez injects new life into the franchise with fresh sequences that feel both familiar and thrillingly original.One of the standout aspects of ""Alien: Romulus"" is its cast, predominantly young actors looking to make their mark in the industry. This approach not only refreshes the franchise but also offers these performers a significant platform to showcase their talents. The lead actress, in particular, carries the film with a compelling mix of vulnerability and resilience, reminiscent of Sigourney Weaver's iconic portrayal of Ripley. Her performance, along with her co-stars, adds a youthful energy to the film, making the characters' plight feel both urgent and relatable. This casting choice not only serves the narrative but also acts as a bridge for new audiences to connect with the Alien universe, potentially building their acting resumes in a franchise with a storied legacy.The sparse attendance at the theater contributed significantly to my viewing experience. The film's tension, which is palpable and often relies on the audience's reaction to jump scares and suspense, was heightened by the absence of a crowd's typical noise. This setting allowed for a more personal engagement with the film, where every creak of the ship, every whisper of the alien, felt like it was directed at me alone. It's an experience that might not be replicated in a packed house, where the collective gasp or laugh can sometimes break the spell of such a film.""Alien: Romulus"" successfully recreates the magic of the original Alien films while offering something new for fans and newcomers alike. Its nostalgic feel, combined with the fresh faces of its cast, makes for a compelling watch. The theater experience, with its intimate setting, only amplified the film's ability to grip and terrify. For anyone looking to revisit the horror and suspense of the Alien franchise with a modern twist, ""Alien: Romulus"" is a must-watch, especially in a setting where you can truly feel the isolation of space.",2024-08-17

Alien: Covenant was a gorgeous mess and I'm happy to see Álvarez is able to understand what makes the Alien movies good and being able to help capture its essence, atmosphere, and horrifying elements. Filled with good performances, monster designs, and some horrifying action moments, Álvarez has definitely become one of the horror filmmakers I have been wanting to keep an eye out and continue to see what else he offers.It's usage of strong practical effects and tension really helped create the sense of dread where you see the characters are being placed in horrifying and scary situations. On it's writing, it does explore some new territories that are interesting, although some choices are a bit thin and the character engagement doesn't feel as strong. Lastly, I don't know if it's my theater, certain presentation moments were a bit too dark which made some shots a bit difficult to see.Despite it's flaws, it's nice to see another Alien movie from it's franchise that holds on the ground.",2024-08-14

Certain scenes will emotionally stick with me for quite a while.The cinematography was beautiful and it certainly was a love letter to Alien fans. The acting was incredible, especially David Jonsson. I have never felt so connected to a character in the first ten minutes of a film before. He was captivating in every sense of the word and pulled this film together.Had I not gone to the latest showing of the day, I would have watched it again right afterward!",2024-08-28
141,Sleepin_Dragon,Better than I thought.,7,"Rain and a group of fellow mineworkers spot an opportunity to scavenge a ship that's laying abandoned in space. Unfortunately for them, it's abandoned, but not empty, and a deadly threat awaits.After Covenant, I learned to manage my expectations, so I went in with somewhat limited hopes, I came away feeling rather satisfied.Definitely better than Covenant, this was an altogether much better film, in terms of story, acting and effects, it definitely felt more 'Alien.'There are a few criticisms, I thought it was very slow to start, and at times it was very predictable, but it's Alien, so you know the kinds of thrill's and spills you'll get, I only wish they'd gone for a more horror vibe.My gripes aren't particularly major, and for the most part I enjoyed it, the visuals were mightily impressive, it's a terrific looking film. A decent mix of characters, Andy my favourite of the bunch, baked by a very strong performance from David Jonnson, for me he stole the show.Several nods to Prometheus, moments that perhaps help to peace that one together.Better than I'd expected.7/10.",2024-08-23
142,dmach-61247,I really enjoyed this ride a lot!,10,"Do not go in with a ton of expectations. After watching ALIENS back in the day on the big screen I was blown away. I was a huge ALIEN fan already and bringing the genre to WAR was exactly what I wanted to see back then. So waiting for ALIEN 3 was a really awesome time and my expectations grew after the fantastic ending of ALIENS with Newt, Hicks and Ripley AND Bishop surviving. So when finally watching it all ma hopes did get destroyed in the first minute of the film... ending in ALIEN 3 being the most stupid film in the franchise because of all the lost opportunities after ALIENS.So this said: I did go to the theater watching ALIEN : ROMULUS without ANY EXPECTATIONS! And to make it clear first: Did this film have flaws: YES! But the more important question: Did I enjoy the ride: HELL YES!I was afraid the young cast would be some kind of bad slasher fic cast... but they worked very well and can act... so this was fine :)
Did they do stupid things: YES... just exactly like most American kids would today! So very realistic on this part too ;)
I liked the movie and the combination of the ALIEN stuff and the details from PROMETHEUS! For me this movie is now ALIEN 3! Go watch it on the big screen.",2024-08-19
143,citizenstonie,Almost Made It,7,"This movie was 10 minutes away from being an 8.5 out of 10 easily.Some choppy FX in a few seems that will be pretty obvious could not stop my giddy feeling throughout the entire film. That is until the last 10 minutes of the film... no... no... no... Some aspects of this franchise are better off dead and buried and forgotten. The director almost achieved it.That said, excellent set design, cinematography, acting and practical effects give Alien fans what they have long hoped for and I am hopeful of a sequel to this film. I give it a 7 out of 10 and only because of story elements of the last ten minutes and a few choppy FX that probably required a little more budget which I know Disney won't screw with next time around.",2024-08-17

But then the third act came, and that were where the movie got really intense, and just kept being like that for the rest of the movie.The Xenomorph design were also amazing, and they had actually kept a good job of showing them through out the movie. And as a person who has seen all of the Alien movies, including the ones with predator in. Then I would say that this movie is in top 3 of them. I would even come as close to say that this movie is THE BEST of them all.So in all I would give it a 9.6 in rating.",2024-08-14
145,pmtelefon,The weak cast hurts more than it helps,6,"I don't know why but I fell for the ""Alien: Romulus"" hype. I don't want to say that I was disappointed but I guess I was. I should have know better. It is a Part 9 after all. ""Alien: Romulus"" is a good looking movie but it suffers from a ""been there, done that"" script and a weak check-all-the-boxes cast. The cast works hard but they're in over their heads. They range from bland to annoying with David Jonsson and Aileen Wu being the annoying ones. (I'll give Jonsson a slight break because his character isn't a good one.) ""Alien: Romulus"" gets off to a bad start but gains its balance during the middle hour. Unfortunately, it spins out of control during the last half hour or so. (I saw this movie at AMC Raceway 10, Westbury, NY.)",2024-08-23
146,Frozone37,One of the best in the franchise!,9,"Finally an Alien film that is a worthy sequel to Alien and Aliens. While it is not better than the two originals, it is far better than the others. Fede Alvarez capture the feeling of Alien incredibly well. The atmosphere, music and claustrophobia were perfect. So many times I was writhing in my seat with an uneasy feeling of what is about to come around the corner.What makes this film even greater is the rare use of CGI and the use of practical effects. While there is one obvious use of CGI for a cameo, mostly everything else looked incredible. The set design is top notch.The cast was decent but the standout was David Jonsson as Andy. Played the best android since David in Prometheus.Overall a great Alien film but an even better horror film in my opinion. A few times I was cringing in my seat from the body horror that Fede implemented. Worth seeing on the biggest screen possible.",2024-08-20
147,Smarmelade,"Should be better, isn't",6,"I did not expect much from this. Yes, Fede Alvarez, and all that - Don't Breathe was cool, Evil Dead remake was kinda not but it was wild at least, and Don't Breathe 2 was very disappointing.So I can confirm that me not expecting much was mostly on point.It started good. I didn't even mind the strong plot connection to the first movie. I even thought that was bold. Young and interesting characters, played by solid cast. I even liked the music, a bit of old with something fresh. Visually, movie was great most of the time, though more on that later.But then, at midpoint, or a bit earlier - they threw everything and the kitchen sink into the plot mix and it was just a mess, glazed with fresh coat of bunch of unncessary old franchise callbacks, one liners and fan services.I mean, wow on that deep fake, whatever CGI was that with a face of a certain character. That was just unbelievable and laughably bad at the same time. Not to mention that there are really great, practical and CGI effects throughout the movie. So this is either a rushjob, studio note at the last minute or something of that nature.And the whole movie gets crushed in the second half with it's bad narrative, bad script and just speedrunning through memberberries. It all felt a bit vision-less. Is this studio meddling or 100% Fede Alvarez, I can't tell.For now, first and second movie still reign far supreme, mostly because of strong directors with a clear, strong vision that was executed well.It is not a bad movie, but it is disappointing because of just how thrown together all of it turned out to be. They could have done way better and way simpler, with a little patience and less callbacks and blatant expositions - less is more, and all that. Definitely needs a second viewing when it comes out on digital.",2024-08-23
148,marshall-61421,Awful,1,"Remaking an inferior version of Alien with elements from others demonstrates a lack of originality and imagination. If the writers are so bereft of talent, they might canvas fans for a script. I can envision numerous scenarios within nanoseconds, one of them being to discard the Ripley character rather than endlessly attempting to emulate the first two masterpieces.Without addressing the contrivances of the plot, it's better to focus on what could be. One can overlook weak acting with a good story, properly directed, but not the converse. There remains an opportunity to create an original Aliens themed movie featuring material that doesn't have to pay homage to the original, that can still furnish heart-pounding action. Unfortunately, it's unlikely such a picture will ever be created if trash like this is rewarded with a squeal.",2024-10-27
149,Ghost33,It was OK,7,"First, I'm a big alien fan. Second, I actually loved prometheus and thought covenant was pretty damn good. I know I'm in the minority in that department but so be it.This movie was OK. It added nothing to the new storyline and didn't really leave me with anything memorable. As an alien movie, it checked most of the boxes. But after prometheus and covenant, I'm looking for more now in that storyline and this movie had absolutely none of that. It's a run of the mill, modern day, Aliens.Not that this a bad thing. But as a general matter, I was disappointed. I'll probably watch it again sometime but my score of 7 feels fairly generous.",2024-10-15
150,saadurrehman70,An amalgamation of the Alien Series' Best,7,"There's something about derelict spaceship corridors juxtaposed with blood and Alien infestation that is so unnerving.I finally saw Alien Romulus last night, and I can say while it had its cliche moments, the overall Ridley Scott original inspired horror was there and it was nerve-racking, dialed up to 11.Its took the best parts of the Alien series to make a good, gritty Alien movie with a fair bit of action and smartly shot scenes of gruesome Alien body horror that it's known for, against the awe-inspiring chaos of space which was rendered beautifully and created tremendous tension and dread.The young cast is okay, if not ridiculous, but the leading actress is very pretty and a rootable protagonist for the Alien sci-fi space much like Ripley.From the yellow spinning alarm lights, to the wailing sirens and the retro analog technology, it was so stylishly honoring the first Alien in it's set design and I was so pleased by what it took from Prometheus and Alien: Ressurrection.It's scary, it's brutal, it's breathtaking and it's downright disturbing or uncomfortable in that ending. You may just leave wondering if Ridley Scott will get to make his Covenant sequel. 5:20am.",2024-09-06
151,jackmanis,Better than expected,8,"I have to admit the trailer didn't do much for me but because it's Aliens I had to go see it. First off the visuals were quite stunning, seen in IMAX was a plus, and the story really did seem concise even though it's a basic concept of most of the alien films. This one wasn't too deep like Prometheous and based more on action and trying to survive. The young, fairly unknown actors did a good job. The lead girl had definite resemblances of Sigourney Weaver's character. With her strength and problematic attitude towards handling the situation in front of her. Definitely top five of this year's movies for me.",2024-08-18
152,jochang-30856,"Pretty good, but nothing new",6,"Another reviewer basically said it best. There's nothing original about this film. I don't mind revisits to winning formulas, but sometimes it's so in your face that it becomes obvious pandering. There's one line in particular that does this and I actually said out loud, ""Why that exact line?"" Instead of enthusiastic nostalgia it became slight cringe.There are also some moments that are completely unbelievable/inconsistent. For one, the way fluid works in zero-g. One could argue from a lore perspective that the specific type of fluid is far more viscous which allows for what we see on-screen, but it just felt like a transparent attempt to use that as a cool factor for the scene. Had that actually happened with the force shown it would have blanketed the entire area with tiny droplets. Dancing around it unaffected is absurd. The other is the way sound is depicted in the vacuum of space. One scene had a loud explosion, and a following one significantly more muted. These may be small criticisms, but suspension of disbelief is important or you may end up being taken out of whatever you're watching.It's not a bad film, though. I enjoyed it. The acting was pretty great for the most part minus one death scene which was typical CGI+acting mismatch. Cailee Spaeny and Isabela Merced deserve special mention. The former has that screen presence to carry a lead role which is always impressive, and the latter exhibits fear fantastically. Very convincing. The inclusion of Ian Holm was appreciated as well, but that may be the fan side of me talking. Try as we do to leave bias out of these things, no one is immune to it.Romulus is an inoffensive addition to the franchise. You won't regret having seen it but unless you're new to the series none of it will stay with you.",2024-10-15

The trailers for this film were so promising, I actually coughed up the $22 bucks for an imax ticket. Let me tell you. Once I got a pedicure in a dodgy salon and I got a staph infection and needed IV antibiotics for a month. That was better and more worth the money than this dumpster fire. I have only ever walked out of one movie, Dracula Dead and Loving It. That movie was Schindlers List compared to this botched abortion. I can't even find the adjectives right now because I'm so angry. Just because you CAN make a sequel doesn't mean you SHOULD. And dude. Bilbo looks ridiculous. The CGI is terrible, the plot is nonexistent, the character development is sub basement quality. Ellen Ripley would be so disappointed.",2024-08-17

Overall I thought the movie was pretty interesting, entertaining & better than it's predecessors (Promethius & alien Convenant). The strong parts of the movie for me were : the acting, action, & some eeriness. However my counter point would be the storytelling/plot. Although not major , there were some parts of movie that didn't feel in the slightest explained. Plus I felt they could've still made some more connections to the other alien movies in the franchise. Also at times the jump scares felt a bit cheesy or just not well placed. 8 out 10.",2024-08-19
155,SteveFOX_86,Prometheus was better,6,"Another Alien movie I was hyped about. Lotsbof praise and silent approval that the franchise was going back to form. Having now seen it, it's a decent attempt, but not much more.Opening was really too quick to give any backstory to the characters.None of the characters had any personality or dimension. Just didn't care if they lived or died.Dialogue was average at best.There is no story here. Just random things to move it along, and all too predictable.Way too much CGI, that kills any real scare or thrill.Full-grown xenomorphs get absolutely slaughtered by kids that never had a day of combat in their life.Just the alien/aliens representation was pathetic.It does look like they tried with this one, but had too little time to flesh it out properly.Prometheus was much better, even with its many flaws. At least there was introduction, characters that sparked interest and some decent dialogue and set pieces.Overall, better than AvPs and Alien 4, but that's about where it ranks. Maybe it's on par or slightly better than Covenant, but can't say for sure. Prometheus was definitely better. Can't touch Alien and Aliens with a barge pole!",2024-10-28

Thankfully, this film lives up to its name, much more so than Covenant - where the big bad is only really shown in the final act; you don't need to worry about that here. Alvarez final touch was casting mostly unknown actors who sell their setting well, and play off one another perfectly.",2024-08-16
157,yourlittletsun,"Finally, a worthy Alien movie.",8,"Whenever there is a new Alien movie, I always keep my expectations low. But oh boy, I was so happy that this movie wasn't another let down.If you're a huge fan of the franchise, you'll notice a lot of easter eggs that pays tribute to the previous movies. The best part is that they decided to reuse the first android model, Ash. The black goo from Prometheus was also included, which was a pleasant shock for me.In terms of horror and suspense, this movie nailed it. The director realized the horror potential of Facehuggers and maximized it here. There were new ideas implemented as well which gave a breathe of fresh air to the franchise.The final act, or the final plot twist, was my favorite part. Who would've thought we could get an 'Engineer-Xenomorph' hybrid? I hope this is a call for the franchise to pick up Prometheus again and explore the world of Engineers.As much as I enjoyed this movie, there were some problems. There was no consistency between all the Alien movies on how the Xenomorphs grow. In this movie, we saw how it got out of the chest and morphed into a cocoon before hatching into an adult Xenomorph. I believe the other movies did not show this.In terms of plot, there is nothing too special about it. Just a bunch of people trying to survive. But, that's also where the problem lies with this franchise. I don't think they want to put an end to the Xenomorphs yet, hence the repetitive plot.But, what matters most is I enjoyed this movie. So, I will give this an 8/10.",2024-08-19
158,anonreviewer,Horrible acting,1,"The first two movies in this alien series are two of the best movies of all time. And the number three and number four movies are also excellent movies but the covenant and Prometheus alien movies were really bad and I could not finish them. Unfortunately this one's the same way.. I can't finish it. Main problem is bad acting bad bad acting... the main protagonist is not a good actor.. there's an Android and he is a really bad actor.. one big problem is the cast is young .. it takes years to develop acting skills.. and because the cast is so young and unskilled, the director can't really take any good shots of the faces of the actors because it would ruin the movie even worse than it's already ruined..",2024-08-17
159,natedog-26628,Alien film influenced by it's predecessors,8,"This film was a really enjoyable addition to the alien series bringing back a classic alien feel while still having innovation. A big reason why I enjoyed romulus was because it took a lot of the previous alien films best qualities. To me, learning what the audience likes most about a film concept seems like one of the more important things a director can do. In this film it feels like the director knew what the audience wanted while also trying to give it their own creative spin. Aside from that, the horror element is prominent throughout the film which is complimented perfectly by its suspenseful sequencing. The characters do have motives but all of them excluding a few are pretty bland in depth. Scattered Easter eggs will also accompany this film for anyone who is a familiar with previous alien installments. There's also a twist which I was pretty indifferent towards. However, it does add suspenseful scenes whilst expanding the alien universe. Overall alien Romulus is well worth your time to watch if you're an alien, or horror movie fan.",2024-08-19

Being a modest box office success, this film had some decent moments of intrigue.With relatively younger cast with steep shoes to fill, lead Cailee Spaeny does a stellar job as the lead heroine. Newcomer portraying the android (David Jonsson) shows enough sympathetic range to root for.The visuals of this film look as good as ever, there is a certain tone and atmosphere which helps with the mood of the film. Some of the deaths were rather bland. The ending was as expected. In the end, it's a decent watch but still feels like it was missing something to be truly great.",2024-12-03

And let's not forget the aliens or xeno's... it was definitely the most vicious and witty versions we've seen yet! My only gripe, I felt the opening was a bit slow but once it gets going it gets going! Also some characters felt a little unimportant and killed off very quickly, if that was the case I say bring more victims for more kills! Otherwise great movie!",2024-08-18
162,ilyushenko,It's OK. But it could so easily have been great...,6,"'Alien: Romulus' kicks off with a bang but unfortunately stumbles and falls in its second half. The first 40 minutes of the movie are beautifully crafted and genuinely feel like a back-to-the roots Alien story. The tension is palpable as we meet a group of young, enslaved space scrap scavengers trying to buy their way off-world, who think they've struck-it-rich when they get first pickings on a derelict space station that isn't quite as abandoned as it first seems.Production design, music and cinematography are stunning, immersing us immediately in the familiar dark and haunting atmosphere of the original ""Alien"" movie. The initial pacing is spot on, creating a genuine sense of dread and foreboding at what will become of the protagonists.However, as the narrative progresses, the film begins to falter. The second half is strewn with clichés that drain the originality and dread established in the first part. Characters start making idiotic decisions to drive the plot forwards into all-too-familiar action territory, leading to frustration for the viewer. It's disappointing to see such strong foundations crumble under the weight of predictable tropes, forced plot twists and awkward repetition of stale ideas.Overall, while 'Alien: Romulus' shines in its opening act, it ultimately fails to keep its promise. The missed opportunity for deeper character development, lack of plot originality and a misguided focus on callbacks to previous canon entries, drags the film down from what could have been the best entry in the franchise since 'Aliens'. Don't get me wrong, I find 'Alien: Romulus' to be a big improvement on both 'Alien: Resurrection' and 'Alien: Covenant', but it could easily have been so very much more. If you're an Alien fan, the first 40 minutes make this movie worth a watch, but be prepared for a wobbly ride afterwards.",2024-11-10

Don't Breath-director Fede Alvarez tries his best to deliver us a thrilling joyride with 45 years old movie franchise.,10,"The best Alien movie since 2012's Prometheus. Don't Breath-director Fede Alvarez tries his best to deliver us a thrilling joyride with 45 years old movie franchise. First, this wasn't gonna come in the cinema at all like 2022's Prey didn't. Luckily Corona time didn't affect anymore. The movie doesn't teach ""the Beast"" new tricks and it's not always needed. Well, I love Aliens ""Xenomorphs"". It's the best movie Monster ever seen. H. R. Giger's creepy art worked always greatly. No other like Alien or maybe Predator. The story is a bit messy trying to take all the best parts from all movies.Cailee Spaeny showed me her acting skills in the movie Civil War. They tried to make her the new Ellen Ripley. Others were very new faces to me. The cast was so young, not any older with them. For example, Borderlands movie used a bit of old actors. The age isn't an issue here anyway.Xenomorphs looked very nice. I was glad everything wasn't made with a computer using a million effects. I am sure the story can continue and hopefully no need to wait another seven years. Alien Romulus is better than 1997's Alien Resurrection and maybe even better than Alien 3. Alien vs. Predator movies are not as good as this, not even the first one. Overall it's better than most movies in this franchise. It's not afraid to try some new tricks. It wants to be a scary movie, but not manage all the way.Alien Romulus reaches same level as Alien Covenant and might be even little bit better. But it can't beat Alien (1979) and Aliens (1986) as I assumed when I saw the trailers. Also, Prometheus is better than this as a story and characters. Everyone like different things and have their own unique taste in movies. Alien fans mostly get what they want, mostly. I am monster movie lover myself. I was happy that Fede Alvarez took some ideas also from one of the best horror videogames there is: Alien Isolation. I love that game.The future of Alien looks brighter than for years and Alien TV series is coming.",2024-08-15

Just watched it and it had a few cringe moments, as some of you have pointed out. Some of the FX, imho, were a bit sub-standard. Characters, other than Jonsson and Spaeny, were annoyingly written, it didn't have to be this way, they could have been made a bit more sympathetic. Still wanted to give it a fair and un-biased viewing. Once over, the good in the movie outweighed the cringe. Critics keep bringing up Jonsson's character being the best thing in this movie, I can't disagree, but I think they overlooked Spaeny. I think she was perfect in this, even gave Weaver/Rippley a run for her money. In my opinion, she made the film work. I liked it, overall. I'd name it as my third favorite in the franchise.

The atmosphere of the movie is very true to the first Alien, dark and claustrophobic, so that was nice. The soundtrack was amazing, one of the few things in the movie that I really enjoyed. The film gets good closer to the ending with some really creepy ideas and images, but they still don't save it in my opinion.

As for the narrative, it has been ruined with each new film that doesn't follow the logic of the previous one. And the Alien story is getting lost, film after film.In addition, in this one, thanks to the incompetence of the screenwriter and director, we still have some of the stupidest decisions imaginable in a film of this type.Extremely disappointing and irritating.

But the movie did not ""wow"" me. The acting was ok. The sets were good (as they should be given the gift of CGI). And the bare necessary links to the original Alien universe are made - placing it temporally after the original Alien film and the happenings upon the ill-fated Nostromo. But there was nothing new, no real twist, nothing setting up for a future thematic diversion. That was the intended task of Prometheus and Covenant, which never got finished. So - while I am obviously bitter about that, don't mistake my gripes with discouragement from Alien:Romulus. Like I said to start, it is very good.",2024-09-02
170,DavidParadiso,"""Retro-Sequel"" (or ""Retro-prequel"")",8,"Fede Alvarez delivers a perfect retro perspective of the technology of the year 2142 like the film was actually shot in the 80's, making this movie a little masterpiece and not only for the fans of the alien with an acid blood. The scenography immerses in the analogic atmosphere of the first two movies of the franchise, particularly of the Cameron's one (interesting the sequence when a character plays a 6 bit videogame).The rhythm is consistent, well shot action sequences and some variations to the range of xenomorphic creatures with at least a couple of interesting surprises.Alien Romulus is really an hazard which beated the risk of failure after two precedent episodes of the franchise directed by Ridley Scott who produced this one...And it is probably more entertaining than the previous ""Alien Covenant"". In fact the Director of the first movie of the 1979, soon after having finished to watch it, swore of happiness as a feedback to Fede Alvarez.",2024-09-29
171,hermonmatthew,It's okay... That's about it.,6,"I'm seeing some pretty positive reviews for Alien: Romulus which is cool to see. I get giddy when I punt the first Alien from the 70s to movie fans because for me, to this day, it's still one of my favourite films of all time. So I really hope Alien: Romulus makes some movie goers fall in love with Ridley Scott's creation.That said, the movie was just okay for me. Nothing earth shattering. I went in assessing the movie on its own merits and dropped my expectations to the bare minimum.Some positives for me:(1) It captured the gritty and ominous feeling of Scott's first Alien. Alien: Romulus did this well. 👏🏽 This is what made the first Alien famous. Pacing, filming and sound effects kept my heart going. There were some well placed jump scares, but they weren't over done.(2) Actual set and model building. In a film making world where movie makers heavily rely on CGI, it was refreshing to see effort into set and model building. Even some of the Xenomorph scenes captured this.(3) The face huggers. Fede Alvarez paid homage to these dudes so well! They've always been a bit of a side show in the Alien series (except when Burke locked Ripley and Newt in that room with them) but they were terrifying in this one. From the cryo room filled with water to them tip toeing through that corridor filled with them, hats off for giving them their due.Some negatives for me:(1) Lack of character development. I didn't feel an affinity towards most of the characters, including Rain. I think this is a broader issue that plagues Hollywood these days. I didn't care who lived or died or what happened to them, whereas in Alien and Aliens, I felt a connection to the characters. I think the only character I was rooting for at the end of the day was Andy.(2) That abomination Xenomorph cross human thing... huh? I was pretty stoked.",2024-08-18
172,aandrain,Revival of the Alien francise,8,"Finally, we have an Alien movie with a well thought-out plot, good characterisation, tense moments and great action! Fans rejoice haha!As an immense fan of the first film (1979 Alien movie), I was completely immersed in how the story developed and thoroughly enjoyed the horror & suspense that the movie delivered on at a high level. There were definitely moments that reminded me of the first two Alien movies and of the Alien: Isolation video game - I'd say they managed to take the best parts from them and delivering a whole experience that combines all the right elements.Highly recommend watching this in theatres, as the visuals and the soundtrack (and sound effects - Jesus, they were great at emphasising tense moments!), were top notch. Alvarez's direction, actors and the rest of the crew - all done amazingly.Finally, I would rank this one after the original Alien movie and after Cameron's Aliens. An overall 8 out 10 (for me, the original Alien movie is a 10, Aliens is a 9).",2024-08-14
173,mrleonw,Alien: Romulus - A Return to Form or a Missed Opportunity?,6,"Overview: Romulus - aimed to blend the atmosphere of Ridley Scotts original Alien, with the more action-oriented elements of James Camerons Aliens.Strengths: Atmosphere and Tension excels in creating a tense atmosphere. The narrow corridors and dimly lit interiors of the mining ship evoke a sense of dread that calls back to the original Alien. Fans of the series will appreciate the return to slower, suspenseful pacing.Cinematography and Visuals: The visual style of was creative. I thought the film made excellent use of shadows and lighting to build suspense, and the space scenes contributed to the overall sense of isolation.Weaknesses: While the tension-building is effective, the middle act drags. Some scenes felt repetitive.Character Development: The characters are undercooked (ie, underdeveloped). While the cast does a solid job with the material, they lacked depth in character development making it hard to truly care about their fates. Fans hoping for memorable new characters may be disappointed.Story Familiarity: Long-time fans of the Alien franchise, like me, may find the story a bit too familiar. While they try to pay homage to the franchise, it often treads too closely to the plots of the original films to me, which offered little in terms of innovation.Final Thoughts: Its a mixed bag. It delivers on the atmosphere and horror that Ive come to expect, but it struggles with development and originality. For die-hard Alien enthusiasts, such as myself, the movie offers some thrills and nods to the series' legacy making it worth watching. However, those of you looking for a fresh take on the franchise might find Romulus lacking.For casual viewers, who enjoy slow-burning horror, its likely worth your time. However, if youre a fan of the Alien universe it might be better to temper expectations and approach this film as a tribute rather than a groundbreaking new chapter.",2024-08-17

Very fun and engaging with a new cast that was quite gifted to my amazement, especially Cailee Spaeny and David Jonsson that had a great character evolution throughout the movie.From an Alien true fan I say congratulations for this Alien masterpiece.",2024-08-20
175,raelthomasrt,Potential half-realised in an entertaining fashion,6,"This film had a great start. The stylistic callbacks to the early films was well done, and it was visually very engrossing. Unfortunately, these callbacks over stay their welcome.Perhaps the strongest element of the film is it's visuals. The set-design & use of practical effects was great and the CGI space stuff also looked very, very good.The setup is good. The tone is suitably horror-esque and cast of characters - whilst lacking a little development - are decent.Unfortunately, in the last two thirds of the film, all of this gives way to non-stop mish-mashing of ideas, themes and callbacks.I feel as though half of this time could've been spent adding a little more depth to the characters and giving some of the set-pieces a little breathing room, in order to up the tension. It's hard to feel much of any, when you're not given time to breathe. It's a pity, as on their own some of these sequences were quite excellent.It feels like this film may have suffered from some studio intervention. ""We must have X and Y from these earlier films"". But unfortunately it mostly suffers for it. There are two particular plot points I feel like the movie would've been better off to leave out. At the end of the film.Overall, it was entertaining. And I probably will watch it again. It isn't up there with the better Alien films (Alien, Aliens & Prometheus (nonsensical plot aside) IMO) but is maybe better than the most of the rest.6.5/10.",2024-08-18
176,markboakes,Superb,10,I have loved alien since the very 1st film. Aliens is one of my favourites and has been a frequent repeat watch over the years. I like most struggled with 3 and 4 and the Predator spin offs. I enjoy Promethius and Covenant and still watch occasionally. Romulus was a return the raw greatness of the 1st 2 films. I was engrossed from the start and enjoyed the unrelenting action. I loved the nods to past films and the expansion of the Alien birth and growth. It was just plain great to watch from beginning to end. Hope they release a Special Edition at some point in the future but despite this I am sure I will rematch.,2024-08-19
177,justahunch-70549,Back to the basics after so many weak or just bad films featuring one of our most famous monsters,7,"Since this is supposed to take place between Alien and Aliens, it makes perfect sense to me that they would go back to the original basics and forget about Ridley Scott's Prometheus route that wasn't working. This truly does go right to the start as we see a blown up Nostromo, another grungy ship and a crew more typical of Aliens than Alien. This film of nearly constant action has some very tense moments and it is a quality product that looks great and without a doubt it is the best Alien film since the first two. It has it's weak points though. It plays around just a little too much with the past films reciting some famous lines that are a little too cute for such a film. They make clever use of the late Ian Holm as another half destroyed android up to no good. Unfortunately, they depend upon this gimmick a little too much. The lead this time is Cailee Spaeney who seems to be in a lot lately and she deserves to be as she is clearly talented, but I don't think she is any kind of imposing presence for this role. Nevertheless, she plays this perfectly well, though she has the same small problem she had in Civil War only more so here. She looks so young. The most appealing performance comes from an actor I had never heard of, David Jonsson. He is really, really good in this. The special effects are, of course, outstanding. The ending sure cries out for a sequel, but I've not heard a word of it and perhaps it's time to give this a rest, but nah. It's Hollywood.",2024-12-08
178,UniqueParticle,Perfect in IMAX - True cinematic superb horror!,10,"Fede Alvarez directed this with such magnificent ghoulish style! Cailee Spaeney along with the rest of the cast were excellent throughout, the cinematography was one of the best aspects, and every other aspect was so damn good. I strongly believe this deserves high ratings at least more than a 7 I'm glad IMDb has it 7.5 at the moment. It's great that Ridley Scott was a producer especially at his age and how there was voice effects of Ian Holm put in very well. Genuinely one of the most satisfying horror thrill rides despite any flaws it is better than most of the Alien films for the terror and some of the best camera shots ever!",2024-08-18

It gives us the freshness of practical effects by placing CGI only where it's necessary; It also uses the same tools that made Alien and Aliens successful.The movie keeps you on the edge of your seat, eager for what is going to happen, which, far from other predictable movies, surprises you in each of its acts without forgetting the ending that manages to connect all the movies with subtle exciting touches.If I have to described it in five word this would be:

180,movieman6-413-929510,"Return to the successful core, but has some minor aspects and could have been more creative.",6,"Alien: Romulus is a new film in the Alien film series. The film is directed, partly written and produced by Fede Alvarez, director of Don't Breath and the Evil Dead remake from 2013.During a more illegal trip into space, a young group of space colonists enter an abandoned space station. Here they come into contact with the most terrifying life forms in the universe.This film is the seventh film in the Alien film series and it takes place between the first Alien film from 1797 and its sequel Aliens from 1986. Director Fede Alvarez tried to bring back the same style of these films for this new Alien film. For this he asked the special effects crew of Aliens for help, to also help in this new film. For example, he tried to use as much physical sets, practical and mechanical effects for the Alien creatures as possible. For later details he did use some visual effects, but otherwise he tried to portray everything in the most realistic way possible. The film is so recognizable for fans and experts of the first Alien film and retains the same, exciting, claustrophobic atmosphere of the more unknown sides of space. There are also some hints to Aliens and other films from the Alien film series. At the end the film does go in a more unusual direction and loses some of the quality of physical, practical, mechanical effects, because at the end they seem to have used more CGI.He also had the help of Ridley Scott, the director of Alien, who returned as producer for this new project. James Cameron, the director of Aliens, helped him further with the script. In this way this film retains a familiar and familiar feeling for fans and experts of the Alien film series, but it plays it a bit safe and lacks further creative aspects. As a result, the film can remain predictable at times.Despite the younger age of the cast and the characters they play, most of them come across well in the film. Cailee Spaeny comes across well as the lead actress along with David Jonsson, who plays the android in the film. Other characters, due to their lesser personalities, you don't really care about as much, so all you can really hope for is for an Alen to get them in a creative way.",2024-08-17

I was so excited to see this movie that if I had to skip the cinema for a year to watch this I would have just to get an advanced look into what could have been the best entry to the Alien franchise since Aliens.Instead I was met with a disappointment and not too much sense - mishmash of different past movies combined. As I've stated before... the idea behind the story seemed like a iron clad idea but the execution in the end wasn't pulled off. Timelines and moments that took hours in the past movies now took minutes (literally as there is a countdown from the start to inevitable destruction of the ship they are stealing from).So the set looked incredible, the cast I actually liked but aliens lacked attack, speed, instinct or that prowess.The ending, was definitely not worth the wait.",2024-08-17
182,funnycommentor,"Probably, one of the BEST alien movies I have ever seen!!",9,"First of all, I have to admit I'm not a fan of the Alien movies franchise, but when I first watched the official teaser of the new movie I liked it and I was so hyped about it. Eventually, it was as good as I had imagined and I enjoyed it, a lot! The plot of the movie was very interesting, but not innovative because it was similar to the previous alien movies. The storyline was very well-written and well-explained, even though it was simple and easy to understand. The characters were very interesting, well-developed and likeable. The filming location of the movie was nice, just a huge spaceship. The casting of the movie was great and their performances were excellent, everyone did a great job of portraying their characters. I have to admit, it was a very intense movie, action-filled and there were too many breathtaking moments. Unfortunately, there weren't many death scenes during the movie, however the killcount was very bloody and brutal. The opening scene was predictable and slow paced, but it was still very promising. The 2nd act was full of chase scenes and gory death scenes. The 3rd act was definitely unpredictable, very creepy and I enjoyed it, a lot. I have to admit, it was a scary, creepy movie and there were some predictable jumpscares. Moreover, the alien's design was very well done and they were definitely terrifying. By the way, the cinematography and the score of the movie were both very well done and they definitely deserve an award about their effort. Overall, ""Alien: Romulus"" was an enjoyable horror/sci-fi film, very bloody, shocking, full of adventurous scenes and I would definitely recommend it to anyone!",2024-08-29
183,willphelan,Exactly What Alien Needed,8,"Alien Romulus takes a little bit to get going but once it does it is a blast. Fede Alvarez brings his signature horror and action direction which works incredibly well for the Alien franchise. Cailee Spaeny obviously does a great job as the film's lead and David Jonsson's performance brings a lot of heart to the film. There's some great use of set up and pay off throughout the film which keeps it very interesting. The sets and visual effects are beautiful and the score is pretty good as well. The mix of practical effects and cgi for the aliens was a prefect balance. There are some inventive action scenes and Fede Alvarez of course makes the third act as disturbing as he can, which I personally liked a lot and I think it helped to make the movie memorable. If you're a major fan of the franchise there are some callbacks that you'll really appreciate but you don't have to have seen any Alien movies prior to this to enjoy it.

But the plot and story is all in all thin and feels a bit cheap. It's clear that they are trying to appeal to the fans and trying to do the two first movies justice, and it some how does for the most part.

The scene had me on edge and there were a couple of great plot twist that i couldn't see coming! The cinematography is fantastic and the colour are amazing. Felt like a modern movie for all the good reasons as in good cgi and camera quality and has all the Benefits of a classic feel to it. I thought the movie was about to end but got hit with plot twist after plot twist without feeling too exhausted and tiring. I did not want this movie to end!

186,rupertmarch,The reset button has been pressed. Good job,8,"Overall, a great watch. Supern CGI, as you'd expect. The CGI created the look of the original model-based special effects. Story cracks along. There is a familiar feel to it, but I wasn't disturbed by that. The use of an AI created character is oddly appropriate (was anyone paid for this ""acting""?). The retro look and tone is a feature - using miles, not kilometers, Fahrenheit, not centigrade, push button and switches, CRT screens etc. My only negative comment was the casting of the male leads. I'm from the UK, but I could barely follow the estuary-English accent. Felt I was in Stoke Newington! Are they sons of Ridley Scott's mates? That all said, enjoyed it and looking forward to the sequel.",2024-08-19
187,stylegamer,Enjoyable alien ride this time for a classic franchise,7,"Alien Rommulus marks a slight departure from the high-octane action sequences of its predecessors, opting for a more character-driven and suspenseful approach by. The film is based on colour palette visual tone of the original Alien (1979) and Alien 3 (1993). Like previous Alien movies that serve as allegories for contemporary events, this installment features themes of capitalism intertwined with exploitation. Alien (1979) can be seen as a commentary on gender dynamics, feminism, particularly through the character of Ripley, who subverts traditional gender roles. The horror of the alien creature can also be interpreted as a metaphor for sexual violence and the fear of the unknown, particularly in relation to the female body and reproductive autonomy. In Aliens (1986) , we saw an allegory of the Vietnam War, .; in Alien 3 (1993) , the AIDS pandemic was a central theme; and Alien: Resurrection (1997) tackled the moral ethics of DNA cloning in the mid-1990s. In Romulus, we can observe the modern-day issues of globalization , the struggles of the industrial proletariat, the young migrant exploitation in an interconnected world , hinted at by the diverse international cast and the events that unfold. The alien creature itself symbolizes the global tyrannies of multinational corporations, the exploitation of the third world world by the first world countries ect.. These themes become very evident in the elevator scenes where allegory of the industrial ""proletariat rising up the ladder"" is being constantly pulled down by the corporate tyranny represented by the Xenomorph.The film does not show the high octane action of 1986 aliens but shows the action mainly through a series of ""what do I do next with limited resources and manoeuvres around obstacles"". As such this sequel of the film franchise relies more on the concept of Alien 3 and Alien Resurrection for its on screen action while allowing the same a deeper exploration of the same psychological and emotional impact of the alien 3 movie. While the film mainly offers close-up shots of the xenomorph, similar to Alien 3, it lacks the extensive screen time and xenomorph character development seen in previous films. This may disappoint fans who crave more in-depth exploration of the alien's biology and behavior. However, for audiences familiar with the series, the limited alien presence doesn't significantly detract from the overall experience.Through the characters' experiences, the film explores themes of isolation, fear, and the human will to survive in the face of overwhelming adversity. The limited resources and claustrophobic environments create a sense of tension and vulnerability that enhances the suspenseful atmosphere. Overall, Alien Rommulus offers a unique and thought-provoking entry into the Alien franchise. While it may not satisfy fans seeking the intense action of earlier films, it provides a compelling exploration of a comtemporary global capitalism theme and the psychological and emotional toll of confronting the unknown.",2024-09-20
188,Terrorbit,An Exercise of Nostalgia But Still Fresh and Visceral.,7,"Reboot of one of the most iconic franchises in the history of contemporary science fiction and horror, returning to the visceral terror and oppressive atmosphere of the classic Alien. Directed by Uruguayan Fede Álvarez, the film takes place chronologically between the events of the first movie and its sequel. Álvarez strikes a balance between action and visual horror, building a tense and claustrophobic narrative that evokes the classic elements of the franchise without falling into a simple exercise in nostalgia. However, the constant homage to the earlier films and some forced narrative twists detract from the freshness and originality of the script, especially towards the end. Added to this is an obvious lack of depth to most of the characters and a minimal contribution to the franchise's lore. On the plus side, the film makes intelligent use of practical effects and features a carefully crafted score by Benjamin Wallfisch that pays tribute to the compositions of Jerry Goldsmith and James Horner. Although Álvarez does not ambitiously expand the franchise's universe, he hints at the potential to reinvigorate the series, clearly opening up possibilities for future sequels.",2024-11-08

Tons of homage to the earlier films, and this is very much the same, recognizable universe. I even saw bits of Blade runner-ish references in the first several scenes. This backs the popular idea that the Blade runner and Alien franchises are in the same universe. *That* would be a hell of a crossover film, wouldn't it? There were only a few of those ""now, why the hell did he/she do that?"" moments, and they're minor. Overall, a really great installment to the franchise - much better than both Prometheus and Covenant. All kinds of recommended.",2024-08-15
190,Stevieboy666,I went in feeling tired and came out with a headache,6,"Another Alien movie, this one is set between Alien, the first (and still the best) and Aliens. The quite basic plot has a group of young space colonists fly a space craft up to the wreckage of a far larger and supposedly abandoned craft in order to steal canisters of some fuel (or something). However said craft houses those infamous face hugging aliens, lots of them! In terms of action and horror it feels like an eternity until something happens but once it does then it is full on. The special effects are great, both CGI and physical. There are a few fairly good jump scares too. The mainly young cast is split between British and American actors, I do wonder if non Brits may struggle to understand what some of the English characters say at times though. Best acting goes to Brit David Jonsson who plays a friendly android. His initial character sounds American but then switches to English when reprogrammed. I am not a huge Alien fan but there are some nice nods and connections with the previous entries. If you are a big Alien fan then I guess you will gain more from it than I, on the other hand if you are looking for a decent horror/science fiction with plenty of action then - after a slow start - you won't be disappointed. Don't think I was in the right frame of mind when I went to see it last night at the cinema, I felt tired and the slow first half didn't help, then when it went into overdrive with the humans versus Aliens I found it too much for my brain and ended up with a headache. Will definitely watch it again in the future but in the comfort of my home.",2024-09-10
191,donmurray29,Bloody great sci fi horror.,8,"Giving this an 8/10 ratingA very fine space horror film, we get very few of them, if any. Plenty of death, action, story, and some fan service. It really looks superb and IMAX will be a big treat for those willing. The film slips in between Alien and Aliens and had to look and sound like a film of that time, which it does.Cailee Spaeny is in her third film this year, so she is very busy and you can she why, a good meaty role to act in, David Jonsson is also superb, all actors are given a much screen acting and deliver.Fede Alvarez has done a great job in the Alien universe, showing the scum of the universe - humans and alien, and desperation is the cause of downfall to all here, desperation and explotation run all over the film. Space jacking never works in these films so this is a classic case of a space jacking gone wrong, horribly wrong. That said, the set pieces are some of the finest and the deaths are clever, the use of outer space is done well, there is a great outside action set that will look brilliant in IMAX.The film is going to be in the top ten of the best of the year, and it's going to be a very mixed bag of films for this year.

192,ggxzbrt,Not as bad as you'd expect,6,"In this day and age where Hollywood is pushing a lot of non sensical movies, Alien Romulus is not that bad.. but not exceptional either. It is a very predictable plot the entire movie and it felt it dragged certain elements a bit longer than needed. What felt a bit off is the cast, not a lot of development, a lot of them easily forgettable as you'd not get attached to any of them.The build up though is intense, it takes its time to get into the meat of the movie and the last act is good, keeps you invested.I wouldn't go into calling this a masterpiece as it isn't. Far from it. But as someone here also said, it is a breath of fresh air. It somehow tries to tie up with Prometheus and with the first iteration of Alien.You should see it in cinema.",2024-08-14

The tension is there, presenting a spine-chilling atmosphere, a breathtaking sound design, and spectacular cinematography. I loved the old-school technology used making the movie feel rather satisfyingly placed in the timeline and the performances from the cast - particularly Cailee Spaeny and David Jonsson - were stellar. While it isn't the most original film out there and the last 15 minutes weren't the greatest (won't reveal it in case anyone wants to see it), Alien: Romulus gave me everything I could want out of it. Thank God, it returns the franchise to its proper roots and gets it back on track. It doesn't feel unnecessarily convoluted or bombastic. It's a fun time and overall a great film.",2024-09-23
194,ryandannar,"Third-Best Film in the ""Alien"" Series",7,"Alien Romulus"" was surprisingly good! As long as you're in the mood for a back-to-basics survival-horror story involving the series' famous creature let loose on a new cast of unsuspecting blue-collar types, this film's got the goods.While the film does lack the slight philosophical musings of ""Prometheus"" and ""Alien: Covenant,"" it is a more solid story than either of those films, with a central brother/sister duo that I actually cared about. Their relationship is unique, and discovering why is one of the film's pleasures.While I'm on the subject of the characters, I also found it refreshing that nobody here does anything overtly stupid for inexplicable reasons. I mean, I might have cracked an ironic joke about the Covid vaccine the moment one character injects a mysterious black drug into herself - but her motives in that moment are pretty understandable, unlike that scene in ""Prometheus"" where the ship's biologist hilariously just decides to ""pet"" the scary-looking space-snake.""Romulus"" just has solid characters, and a solid story with well-realized beats. The whole affair is made from recycled parts, of course - and yet, what writer/director Fede Alvarez does with those parts really works. It has verve.And it's not afraid to lean into the strength of the first two films, even as it expands the lore of the spacefaring (and soul-crushing) Weiland-Yutani corporation, and the unfortunate humans caught in the hellish lower-rungs of their colonialist activities.There are scenes here which do, visually, move beyond anything we've seen in a previous ""Alien"" film. I particularly liked the first act, which gives us a glimpse into to an operational Weiland-Yutani mining colony. I mean, sure, the Director's cut of ""Aliens"" gave us a taste of that - but nothing like this. This feels fully-realized, rich, and nightmarish.As you might expect, there are endless references back to the first couple of films - some subtle, some not so subtle. These references run deep, and yet the film doesn't ""rely"" on them to generate interest. The nostalgia factor is there in a big way, and yet the film stands quite well on its own.The only other thing I'd like to mention is just how happy I am that they returned to the aesthetic of the first couple of films. There was something inherently spooky about the lived-in janky retro tech of the first couple of films, which just really got lost when Ridley Scott updated to a ""cleaner"" look for ""Prometheus"" and ""Covenant.""These ships need to look grimy, they need to have large and clunky command-consoles with flashing buttons - and most of all, the visual displays need to be crackling wavering old CRT screens, not clean flat LCD's or holographic projections. No. Fede Alverez's film know this; he knows that there is a spookiness in old analog equipment which lends itself really well to ghost-ships. And yes, he gives that to us.Ultimately, I'd probably grant this film a solid seven. It's not trying to do anything all that new or unusual. But it squarely hits the basics, in ways that none of the Alien sequels really have, apart from James Cameron's ""Aliens.""

And today Alien Romulus brought us the technology, great directing, thrill ambient, simple plot but fun to watch and somehow the movie brings nostalgic moments.The connections between characters is also build so good, so we can feel the emotions, the movie starts pretty slow at begginings but when the thrills come out, its never stop till the end.

196,verrucktcarlos,A visual spectacle,7,"From the get-go, one thing is obvious about this film. The people behind it are truly passionate about their craft.Finally, we have real sets and real props, it was fantastically executed. The visuals are just incredible. We have lots of color, lots of contrast, wonderful lighting, just a delight.The visuals are just great, no complains about that, but the movie has missteps in other areas.A lot of people mention the characters and I agree. I didn't really care for anyone.I also felt that it was too much, the movie needed to slow down at one point. Some people say it is slow, I found it way too fast. Fantastic looking and thrilling scenes but way too many in my opinion.The original Alien succeeded in its simplicity. Only one Alien, lurking in the dark, taking the passengers one by one. This film had too much going on.I am familiar with Fede's work as I have seen Evil dead many times, actually, this film has callbacks not only to previous Alien films but also to his Evil Dead remake. If you've seen it, you will be able to draw the parallels, especially with the final creature, that by the way, the people in the theater audibly gasped when it appeared.The first Alien remains the best by a long shot, but this one is pretty good.

I was hoping there would be more gore, but this is more of a mainstream movie.The 2D 4DX experience was below average, because the effects were scarce and the screen didn't show a true black color. Perhaps IMAX or a proper screen will be more immersive. There was an attempt at mimicking zero gravity, which I appreciate. However, the sound of chairs squeaking around breaks this immersion.The movie starts out with communist dystopia, and ... well, you'll see the rest.

Seems like a bunch of kids yip yapping and screaming unnecessarily. Have insane hopes on this movie after watching all these years. Felt a letdown. Prometheus, covenant were all dark and scary. This just seemed to miss that vibe! On top of that the typical teenage non sensical argument of holding the wheel/seat on a spaceship, sounds dumb and immature.

The only actors that were good people were the girl and her Forest Gump android. He was a pretty good android, for a change.

At least the horror genre has been tainted with dull and cheap movies that you cannot remember a day later. Alien: Romulus is a refreshing piece even as its roots are in classic sci-fi horror.The atmosphere is right from the start and the plot gets going instantly. No need for drawn out scenes of pointless discussions. The movie looks incredibly good even though it's quite dark most of the time. Everything fits together nicely and the action is very seamless.The cast is amazing. I genuinely enjoyed watching actor and actresses that I don't know. They worked well together and the chemistry between Andy and Rain was definitely there. The accents were a nice add, no generic yankie talk.The only down side was that the action was just a bit too perfect at times. I get it, this type of movie requires a lot of close calls, but perhaps there was those too much.But overall I strongly recommend and all the nods to previous Alien-movies.

She has an android, Andy, that is not really up to standards, tells terrible jokes, but is a good companion who she cares about. Her chance comes when a derelict wreck comes close, and her friends hope to get fuel from it, and escape. Should only be a 30 minute job. What they find is not what they expected, and a wreck of an android tells them the prime directive has been changed, and what they found is the most important thing to the corporation.

203,hammad_khn,Suspense packed!,10,"**Alien: Romulus Review***Alien: Romulus* brings back the creepy and intense vibes that made the original *Alien* movie such a classic. Directed by Fede Álvarez, who's known for making scary and gritty films, this new addition to the franchise is both fresh and familiar.The story follows a new group of characters who are far away from the original *Alien* storyline with Ripley. They're on a mission on a distant planet, but things quickly go wrong when they realize they're not alone. The movie builds up the suspense really well, with the alien lurking in the shadows, keeping you on the edge of your seat long before it actually appears.Álvarez does a great job of creating tension and horror throughout the film. There are some seriously intense and gruesome scenes, making the movie a nerve-wracking experience. The setting is dark and creepy, with narrow hallways and dim lighting that remind you of the original 1979 film. The music and sound effects add to the eerie feeling, making you feel the terror in every quiet moment.The actors do a solid job, especially the main character, who shows both fear and strength as things go from bad to worse. The relationships between the characters feel real, and you can sense their growing panic as they understand the nightmare they're in. However, some of the crew members don't get much character development and feel like they're just there to be alien bait.Visually, the movie looks fantastic. The mix of practical effects and CGI brings the alien to life in a terrifying way. The creature design sticks closely to the original but with some new twists that make it even scarier.While *Alien: Romulus* doesn't change the game for the series, it brings back what made the original so great-fear, tension, and survival. It's a solid addition to the *Alien* franchise that will please longtime fans and anyone who enjoys a good sci-fi horror movie. The film respects its roots while standing on its own, proving that the alien is still one of the scariest monsters out there.**Bottom Line:** *Alien: Romulus* is a thrilling and scary movie that sticks to what made the original great. It's a must-see for fans of the series and anyone who loves a good horror movie in space.",2024-08-18
204,johanngg-51125,Best Alien movie in years but...,7,"Alien: Romulus is a thrilling return to form for the iconic sci-fi horror franchise, delivering the best Alien movie experience since Aliens. The film strikes a balance between high-stakes action and atmospheric tension, making it a worthy addition to the series. The cast is excellent, with standout performances that ground the film's horror in human emotion. Each character feels well-realized, adding depth to the tension as they face the relentless Xenomorph threat.Visually, Romulus is stunning. The cinematography and production design harken back to the original's grimy, industrial aesthetic, while incorporating more modern, sleek visuals that make the world feel larger and more alive. The Xenomorphs have never looked better, with their terrifying design and presence amplified through clever use of lighting and practical effects.However, where Alien: Romulus stumbles is in its ending. Unfortunately, it feels too derivative of earlier films in the franchise, particularly the original Alien and Alien: Resurrection. The climax and final showdown don't offer anything fresh or innovative, rehashing familiar beats we've seen before. While it doesn't ruin the overall experience, it leaves the film feeling somewhat predictable at the finish, which is disappointing given the creative promise of the rest of the movie.In summary, Alien: Romulus is a visually spectacular and well-acted entry that reinvigorates the franchise, even if its conclusion feels overly familiar. Fans of the series will find plenty to enjoy, but the film falls just short of becoming a new classic due to its unoriginal ending.7/10.",2024-10-20
205,lordtibo995,A tense return to the franchise,7,"Alien Romulus is the seventh installment in the Alien franchise. While this series has seen a lot of highs and lows, this film stands as a solid entry. You can feel that Fede Alvarez is a genuine fan of the franchise, and he delivers on what a lot of fans want from an Alien movie.Aesthetically, it fits in with the first two movies. The atmosphere, sound effects and set designs are on point helping the feeling of no escape and the constant sense of danger. The film keeps you on the edge, constantly aware of how everything could go horribly wrong at any moment.The Xenomorphs are another highlight, delivering the gore fans expect without going overboard or looking overly CGI-enhanced. Much of what you see is achieved through practical effects, which adds to the film's gritty, authentic feel.Like the first Alien movie, it is a slow burn in the beginning, but once it takes off, it doesn't stop. I personally don't have a problem with that but it is something thats probably not for all.However, there is a bold narrative choice in the film that deviates from its otherwise safe territory. While this twist might appeal to some, it felt out of place for me but it didn't take away from the good parts of the movie.Overall, Alien Romulus is a solid addition to the franchise that many fans will enjoy. While it takes a few risks, the film largely succeeds in delivering the tension, atmosphere, and visceral horror that have made the Alien series iconic.",2024-08-15

208,ngathant,Masterful Scifi Horror,10,"Just got back from the biggest IMAX screening and might go back again. Wow! It was fkn INSANE! I'm thoroughly entertained!I didn't have a good first impression of the movie seeing the young faces taking on the franchise. It was also building up the new characters the first 30 min or so without a lot of action. I was glad to be wrong about the new faces and the rest of the movie picked up! Having watched Civil War recently too, Caile is becoming a favorite. Low key very strong actress who display it subtly. The world building in Romulus is bananas. I got depressed watching their mining planet. It felt too real and it makes a lot of sense. Any other moon or planet aren't designed for human occupation. It will be depressing.Some folks complain about Romulus lacking originality. I don't get it. This is a decades long franchise. The expectations is all wrong there. You will see the same damn xenomorph. It's a franchise. It's in the title. What else do you expect?I like how most scenes are thought out carefully and not defy common logic overly to force an easy narrative. Sure, the dumb bish and dude are still in it to trigger you but obvious things follow logic and most importantly follows basic science in a sci-fi film. Very clever use of the environment throughout the movie. It's all sciency not just made up sheesh.The story is not brand new. It ties back all other Alien movies in a great way. It's not just shock and awe and visual effects. There's a strong why behind the whole movie if you are up to date with other Alien movies. The way this movie connects to all others is also very natural and logical and not forced at all. Again, it follows logic which is hardly the case in most shock and awe horror movies. I appreciate that very much.I give it a 10/10 because I'm very much entertained and love how every action makes sense and follow science. I like how I was completely absorbed into the movie. However, I've not been happy with how slow and selective the xenomorph is in general in all the movies not just Romulus. It's like she's thinking of who the main characters are and taking her damn time. I want to see an absolutely brutal animal with SPEED. The story should be more unpredictable on who lives and who dies. They morph so fast from the face hugging and chest busting to a full blown xeno but they can be thinking too much on who to kill. I want to see an absolutely terrifying ALIEN.I also agree with the general statement they made about humans in space colonizing other planets. That's a strong why I can get behind and it very much explains Alien Covenant and David. Like I said, I might rewatch it again in IMAX. It won't be the same back home on TV.",2024-08-17
209,joaorefosco-18874,Stop getting used to mediocre.,6,"Both 1979's Alien and Aliens are among the greatest films in the history of cinema, they were historic milestones both in their respective genres (action and science fiction) and in cinema in general, having created one of the most iconic characters in history, heroine and also scenes. Alien Romulus does have its qualities, aesthetic details, photography and scenery/ambiance that refer to the classics, but just because someone found their way back, doesn't mean we have to treat it as a masterpiece, as I see a lot of the criticism, in fact I dare say that most of the criticism must only have references to the first two Aliens pulled from memory. There is no comparison, the first two are masterpieces and cannot be placed even close to Alien Romulus, I think the most coherent thing would be to compare the film to Prometheus, Covenant, 3 and 4, which are indeed well below average Aliens, it's like if it was a competition for third place, and third place was light years away from the first 2. It's not a bad film, but when I saw the review, I thought it was another consolidated and respected edition for the franchise, and I ended up noticing that despite certain qualities, its script and characters have a totally generic formula. Alien and Aliens are absurdly fantastic films, and putting Alien Romulus as a bronze medal sounds shameful. For me, the Alien platform had and continues to have only 2 placements. Reasonable film, but not impressive.",2024-08-19

211,BoBo_Goal32,"Another ""Alien"" sequence",7,"I haven't watched the original ""Alien"" trilogy when it first came out and became famous and iconic. I joined it when it was less ground braking but still relevant as horror corner stone and a mile stone as sub-genre in horror.I appreciate and admire Ridley Scott for giving birth within Alien Birth in his trilogy and then a little bit more and I think he gave also birth to a total independence space horror sub genre in horror films and i say it most respectfully - it seems that its the same all over again now.We've seen this formula in a lot different other films with smaller budget and producers behind them. The concept is the same, the execution is different. Now Scott produced and picked a fantastic director that can execute according to Scott's vision and picked a fine crew with two great leading actors.The idea stays the same. The place in the timeline is somewhere between the two iconic two first films and the tribute to both of them is shown from several different angles of this current film. The respect to Scott's legendary movies is noticeable for the fans and seems that Fede Alvarez is a fan, that supplies some fan service regarding the content of his film.I gently guess that if it wasn't an ""Alien"" sequel, this movie was treated differently and maybe not with that kindness and respect. It has young and almost unknown cast members (except Cailee Spaeny, which her name is souring to new heights lately), a plot that resounding the original movies over and over again and turn of events that doesn't requires any special guesses.Unlike any small budget movies in this sub genre, this movie knows how to get his dedicated audience to respond and knows what Will his audience will respond to. Alvarez knows exactly how to execute each and every key scene and how to manage the gaps between the the thriller and the horror parts of the movie.It's speaking, once again, about a company that prefers her benefits and needs before humanity, it has an android that smells like a real person and a female leading character that needs to prevail against all odds.

Most of the film had less than 10 characters, so the waters were not too muddied. Common horror tropes were followed (e.g. Darkness to be scary) but it really wasn't too bad, there was even some originality.

The actors all did a great job and I REALLY liked the two main characters relationship throughout the whole movie. I was rooting so hard in the end for them to survive.

215,ian-47918,Chest-Bursting with Atmosphere,7,"By Ian Chandler - September 4, 2024Alien: Romulus is yet another film in the Alien franchise, which will be 50 years old by the end of the decade. The first two are fan favorites, and the rest are, well, not fan favorites. With director Fede Álvarez at the helm, Romulus is, in many ways, different from earlier entries. Its atmospheric, beautiful, and disturbing. But even older films had those elements; so, its quality relies heavily on the overall execution. After several films that failed to connect with audiences, does this new one break the unfortunate franchise norm?The first and most apparent aspect of the film is its atmosphere and cinematography. Alien: Romulus boasts, without a doubt, the best camera shots of the year so far. Deep blacks and silhouettes clash with vibrant colors, angles are eerie, and environments shown behind the lens feel claustrophobic. The film demands its viewers to see it in 4K UHD, as anything lower brings a lesser experience. Also benefitting the vibe are the practical effects. Yes, CGI is still used, but it is pleasantly surprising to see real props such as face-huggers crawling around the premises. Xenomorphs also look very good, with movements and behaviors that are somewhat similar to the oldest Alien outings. The final main ingredient to Romulus's brilliant atmosphere comes from its score. It is not memorable, but it does exactly as it was intended: it elevates tension when needed. A portion of the soundtrack is reminiscent to older space films like 1979's Alien and the original Star Wars, bringing that adventurous, but mysterious feel.What's a mixed bag are the characters. The two leading characters, Rain and Andy, are likable protagonists that are worth investing in. David Jonsson, who plays Andy, is easily the best actor in the film, as his character is complex and demands a lot to be believable. Jonsson nails the part, potentially making this film his breakout role. Another character is also engaging due to their unnerving dialogue and creepy delivery; however, their appearance will strike controversy. Everyone else, unfortunately, are lacking in depth, as they are given little time in comparison to the more prominent ones. Characters' decision making is not laughably witless like other particular Alien movies; but there are still some actions that raise eyebrows. Speaking of raising eyebrows, Romulus, in pure Álvarez fashion, is quite disturbing. Though a bloody, violent misadventure is nothing new to Alien, this entry features some really freaky ideas; the iconic chest burster is not the most graphic scene in the movie if that says anything.Despite horrific imagery and gripping suspense, the film fails to scare any adult. Many sequences are predictable and jump scares are both mild and cheap. If they deviated from the standard horror structure just a bit more, its already spectacular atmosphere could have made Romulus a truly terrifying film. Xenomorphs are also, unfortunately, not very intimidating. If there was one thing to learn from the film's inspiration, Alien Isolation, it was that one cunning alien hunting in the dark is far scarier than several average monsters running about. What also lessens the tension is the out of place fan service sprinkled in the film. Not all of it is offensive, but there are some blatant callbacks to the first two movies that briefly yanks the immersion away.Though it hardly frights, just about every other element delights. Some characters are interesting, the camerawork is exceptional, the music is appropriate, and the overall world is entrancing! If the flow of events had more twists and the action was toned down, this film would have potentially been up there with the critically acclaimed classics. Even so, Álvarez and his obviously passionate team have created a rare winner in the long running Alien series. It is certainly worth watching in theaters and also worth buying on 4K whenever that comes out.Alien: Romulus - 74/100
Álvarez's take on the franchise is an atmospheric treat, with great practical effects and moody lighting. However, the film struggles on the concept of ""less is more.""",2024-09-04
216,raising_downwards,Could it be any more predictable?,4,"I went to the premier not expecting much and I was still disappointed.Alien Romulus is basically a repeat of Alien, except you don't care about the characters at all.First of all, if I had to rate this ""horror"" movie solely on the scare factor, I'd give it 0 stars. It relied only on jumpscares that didn't startle a single person in the cinema. The producers tried to create a tense atmosphere, but that simply wasn't good.The xenomorphs and face-huggers have lost all novelty and scariness that they used to have in the first movies of the franchise, almost like the movie isn't about them anymore.Frankly, I don't see how this movie has contributed to the timeline.Now, onto the mc and scs: It's been less than three hours since I've seen this film and I don't remember any of their names, faces, nor importance. There's no character development for anyone, you end up not caring about what happens to them.You've got the: *SPOILERS TILL THE END* Person who dies 1, person who dies 2, 3, woman who's pregnant and gives birth to the only ""plot twist"" that actually was kinda interesting but also of no actual significance in the grand scheme of things...And oh, the mc is the only person that survives the whole ordeal; the same way Ellen Ripley did in Aliens - Throwing the xenomorph out of an 'airlock'. Wow, really creative there, right?I give this 4 stars because the only thing I really liked were the scenery shots. Very cool space and ship design, I wish it were shown more.All in all, it might be worth watching it at the cinema just for the graphics. Otherwise, I think it was a waste of everyone's time.",2024-08-14
217,JTReviewsPlus,Easily the best movie since Aliens,7,"I was ecstatic when it was originally announced that Fede Alvarez was attached to the Alien franchise. His admiration for the genre and the sci-fi classics can be felt throughout Alien: Romulus for better and worse.The production, use of practical effects, and atmosphere are authentic to Ridley Scott's vision almost to a fault. There hasn't been a movie that felt quite like it since 1986's Aliens but with that comes some apparent issues. For one, the use of references at times felt too in your face. I love homages and easter eggs more than the average person but once you start quoting lines from other movies in cheeky and random ways you start to lose me.Another part of Romulus that took me out of the experience was the lack of buildup. Things start to hit the fan not long after audiences are introduced to the crew and the space station. Yeah, the stakes progressively ramp up but it starts pretty intense immediately after the slower first act. On top of pacing issues, there are a lot of story contrivances that are hard to overlook. Some scenes feel sped up while others are left unanswered or vague.Rain is a protagonist that is easy to root for thanks to Cailee Spaeny's convincing performance but she isn't given much to do in the grand scheme of things. It's hard not to draw comparisons to Sigourney Weaver's Ripley because of what both characters ultimately go through so it can be distracting for longtime fans. (The rest of the cast also do a great job with David Jonsson's performance being the most memorable).Alien: Romulus is easily the best in the franchise since Aliens. Its use of practical effects, convincing cast, and set designs capture the intense atmosphere of the original 2 movies. Unfortunately, Alien: Romulus's lack of build-up in the first act, convoluted story, and heavy reliance on callbacks prevent it from reaching greater heights.",2024-08-17

This film pushes the boundaries of fear and excitement, offering a relentless assault on the senses that will keep you gasping for air.Directed by Fede Álvarez, known for his mastery in horror with films like Evil Dead, Alien Romulus introduces new horrors while paying homage to the franchise's roots. Álvarez's fresh perspective infuses the film with his signature style, creating a visceral and terrifying experience. The xenomorph returns, more menacing and brutal than ever, enhancing the film's palpable tension and suspense.The production design is a standout feature, capturing the gritty, industrial aesthetic of the original Alien, The spaceship's claustrophobic corridors and dimly lit chambers amplify the sense of dread, with practical effects blending seamlessly with CGI to create an immersive, nightmarish environment. While some CGI moments falter, they do little to detract from the overall impact.The film follows the crew of the USV Anesidora, who respond to a distress call from a derelict spaceship reminiscent of the one from the original film. As they investigate, they awaken a deadly threat that challenges their survival. The diverse cast brings depth to their characters, from a haunted captain to a reckless scientist, each contributing to the film's emotional and psychological tension.Alien Romulus not only respects the franchise's legacy but also expands its universe with fresh elements and evolving themes. The xenomorph's new design is both familiar and innovative, embodying pure primal terror. The film explores themes of survival, sacrifice, and scientific ambition, emphasizing the human spirit's resilience in the face of overwhelming odds.In summary, Alien Romulus is a triumphant return for the franchise. It captures the essence of the original while introducing exciting new elements. With its stunning visuals, intense action sequences, and well-developed characters, it delivers a space horror masterpiece that will haunt you long after the credits roll.",2024-08-25
219,waynemcauliffe-74605,The Alien is back,8,What i like and don't like about this movie. First up i think it's pretty bloody great. The best of the franchise since the first 2. I like how the cast is young this time and are kind of indentured servants/slaves and need a spacecraft to escape. I think David Jonsson as Andy is the best actor because he does his great change around. Very good. Rain is great too as a younger Ripley and she makes the dispatching of the Aliens believable even though she is a small woman. What i didn't like so much is the ending where some of the Prometheus nonsense turns up. Not a huge fan of that one. Still great on the big screen. Viva Fede's Alien.,2024-08-20
220,mrmurr9909,An Alien Buffet,7,"When I saw Fede Alvarez was directing this movie, I had some things I hoped for...
1) The small, suspenseful, and claustrophobic atmosphere of ""Don't Breathe.""
2) The right combo of brutality and gore of ""Evil Dead.""
These elements seemed like perfect calling cards for an Alien film. After the trailer launched, seeing the movie appeared to take place on an isolated ship like the original, I was convinced the objective was complete.Not only did the film deliver in the areas I hoped, but it brought in many of my favorite chunks and elements from the previous films. I will avoid spoilers but there are many parts that are recycled for this film, but not in the ""Here they go again, redoing the same film over again"" type of sampling that some casuals criticize the franchise for. Alien, Aliens, Resurrection, Alien 3, Prometheus, you name it! There are small pieces from these movies that were reinvented and it all came to together quite well.I was beyond satisfied with this movie, and I'm happy Alvarez delivered another high-quality film.",2024-08-16
221,FlynnsList,Impeccable Directing,8,"8.5 - The directing (and specifically the directing of the cinematography) is truly impressive. You consistently see a wide shot of what is happening and then a zoom back to the scene/a closer/different perspective and that always gives the viewer the perfect amount of context to grasp the scope and gravity (no pun intended) of a given situation. It naturally pulled you into the plight of the characters and into the spaceship itself. It felt very effortless in the way that it cast its spell, and I credit the directing for that completely.Then there was the writing/direction of the scenes, the moment to moment ""how are they gonna get out of this one"" and the set-ups within the set-ups were very impressive and barely ever was I like ""yeah right"", most of the time I was like ""OH that's right!"" It was so good.Add to that a couple very unique/Iconic sequences/touches which differentiated it and allowed it to stand on its own (E.g. Touches like the xray device, and scenes like acid swimming, and even monsters like that one...) got big bonus points from me. Wonderful really, I hope we get ""Remus"" or part 2 at some point and hopefully it's equally well done!Highly rec, even if you just love the art form but not the series, still 100% worth. This is very well done.",2024-08-24
222,tvalstar99,Fun,7,"Negatives: - too young protagonists. I found it unbelievable that these young people working in a mining colony could just fly spaceships. - although the film takes its time to introduce the characters, I mainly remember Andy and the leading actress (whose name I can't remember anymore) -it is not original, the film takes what works from Alien and Aliens -a bit too much explanation. The film would have worked without RooksThe good -the acting is sufficient -the emotion between the lead actress and Andy is believable - the film is exciting although it is a bit too redundant and gross at the end, but the film does not feel too long -the female lead is just a girl and not a mary sue or woke.A good 7.

223,SnoopyStyle,YA truckers in space,7,"A Weyland-Yutani ship has retrieved the original alien about twenty years after the first movie and they start doing experiments on it. Rain (Cailee Spaeny) is an orphan working in the company mine. Her parents died there. She hopes to leave for a better planet with her android companion Andy (David Jonsson), but the company changes the rules on her. Her ex-boyfriend Tyler (Archie Renaux) and his friends had discovered an abandoned ship. They need Andy's help to reactivate it.This is pulling from all of the original four. It starts with cornbread and drinking bird. They don't need to do that. It's bringing back so many pieces from the originals. So they're not exactly truckers as much as miners. Again, the movie is bringing all that sensibility. The first half is a lot of company being bad and a lot of action. The second half is more horror-action. The last half hour is a bit stretched out, but I do really love the cargo crashing into the ice. Cailee Spaeny is good. She's basically a younger, shorter, softer, and more naive Ripley.

But if you understand it... this movie is A+ Not much more to say. ""The Offspring"" was a very interesting addition and used the psychological and physiological Horror coined in the first movie. The terror of something infesting like a parasite, really leaves the viewer feeling violated themselves to a certain extent.

225,svederen,Two thirds of a good Alien movie,6,"As an avid fan of the first four Alien movies, I found a lot to like about Alien: Romulus, but I also felt that it fell short towards the end.On a technical level it's a great film. I loved the practical effects and the amazing sets they built. They felt real and lived in with a tactile quality that is so often missing from movies today. I was also pleasantly surprised by the acting from a cast that I have not seen before in anything else.Alien: Romulus does an admirable job introducing us to its main characters, and for the most part it gives us a good enough reason to care about what happens to them. From there we get sent on a suspenseful journey that slowly builds into a horrific nightmare. There are some truly memorable horror scenes that may become as iconic for the franchise as Ripley's face-to-face with the Xenomorph in Alien 3, or her dock-loader moment in Aliens.Unfortunately, the script veers off into fan-service about two thirds through. Instead of introducing their own memorable lines, we're treated to repeats of iconic lines from prior Alien movies. We also get parts of the plot from several of the previous entries. With just a third of the movie left, we're introduced to a bunch of new storylines that seemingly try to tie Romulus to every other Alien film that came before it. The result is a bit of a messy ending, that left me wishing the editor had just left the last 30 to 40 minutes on the cutting room floor. It was a little jarring because everything up to that point had been tightly focused.To sum up my review, I found Romulus to be an enjoyable watch with some truly unsettling horror moments, but it felt like overly indulgent fan-service and lack of more stringent editing kept us from getting what could have been a truly great Alien movie.",2024-08-31
226,stebo-58420,Absolutely loved it,8,"I can't believe all the hate for this movie, I don't understand any of it. It's nonstop action and tells the story of another group of people terrorized by Aliens. It connects Prometheus with Alien with Aliens with Alien 3. Just when you think it's over, there is more. I was on the edge of my seat for most of the film. See this one on the biggest screen you can find, it's worth the extra few bucks for imax or XD.The stars are likable, like all Alien movies - there are good guys and bad guys. That's to be expected. And you want to scream at the screen and tell them to stop being so stupid! Outstanding! Best Alien movie in decades!",2024-08-16
227,Chris5712,A major disappointment,4,"First and probably last review I'll probably write on here.Just got out of seeing Alien Romulus. If you haven't paid much attention to the franchise it's OK, if you have watched all the other movies it's complete bobbins. Every thread from every other movie is in it. Plot holes as big as those made by the acid blood. Terrible acting from some of the cast. No original ideas compared to the other 6 movies (excluding the Predator nonsense) and too many references to the other movies making it a homage with absolutely no point.If you haven't booked to see it already I'd wait until it's streaming.",2024-08-16
228,martinrobertson300482,Pretty good,7,"Like most people i love the original ""alien"" and its masterful followup ""aliens"" but the rest just kind of merge together. This new one seemed like a winner being closer in spirit to those first 2 movies though, and for the most part i loved the movie. Until that last random 15 minutes or so derails it all.Overall though it is still mostly great. There's enough tense moments to keep fans of the original movie happy, and enough inventive action to also please fans of the second. But the characters are also a mixed bag. The guy who plays the android is very good, but i couldn't wait for one of the other annoying characters to get eaten or whatever as soon as possible.Director Fede Alvarez adds enough new ideas while also paying plenty of (mostly good) homage to the classic movies until it starts gettting closer toward that ending. Where even the callbacks start getting a bit much. Then the last part really had everyone leaving the cinema with a bewiddled look on their face.",2024-08-20
229,rotten-potatoes,2 xenomorphs up,9,"This film was an attempt to bring Alien fans something fresh and new! Two specific parts of this movie delivered something we had never seen before! And Romulus succeeded with those attempts.Some people are complaining about the age of the cast and the British accents. Most American movies feature numerous British actors, accent or not. And as regards to the age of the cast, I noticed that and took exception for like 5 minutes of the movie. But did the age and casting cause any further distraction? Hardly. There was one actor who you knew for the entire 20 minutes of their screen time that they were gonna get the dead face, but besides him, the casting choices were fine.I really loved the android arc as well.My only criticism would be we didn't get to see enough casualties. I feel bad admitting that but, if there were more the suspense might have felt a tad better.In any event, great addition to the Alien franchise and I can't wait til I see it again!",2024-08-28
230,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Enjoyed it for the most part,7,"We have a new Alien film on our hands for the first time since 2017's disappointing Covenant and Fede Alvarez's Romulus is, for the most part, a slappin' great time at the movies. Taking place in a specific chapter of time between Alien and Aliens, it chronicles a team of young Weyland-Yutani employees who feel a bit more than disillusioned with the company and decide to hijack a derelict vessel floating in orbit above their bleak, dreary mining colony planet and get the hell out of proverbial Dodge. You don't have to guess what's waiting for them onboard and pretty soon they're faced with a fight not just to escape horrible bosses, but one for their very lives. The decision to cast Cailee Spaeny here is a great one; she first caught my attention almost walking away with the otherwise underwhelming Bad Times At The El Royale and has since been on a meteoric hot streak. Her protagonist Rain is one of the best lead characters in canon, a badass, bruised warrior with a fierce emotional compass and the will to survive. There are a few things that didn't work for me; some on the nose verbal references to other films in canon were kinda lame and the choice to add the cameo of a long deceased character (and actor, I might add) using really dodgy CGI is... questionable and didn't resonate at all with me. I was hoping the film would more do it's own independent thing within the Alien-verse rather than try so hard to tie in to every little aspect and please all the disparate fans spread out over the galaxy of what has been a decidedly segmented, somewhat divisive franchise since it began all those light years ago. Nevertheless, Alvarez's passion for the lore shines through and he has wrought a visceral, propulsive iteration that excites around every bend and has some of the nastiest, squirmiest gore and creature moments to date.",2024-08-22
231,cedricdumler,A powerhouse of craft that beautifully marries the legacy of Scott's original with Álvarez's unique vision.,9,"Alien: Romulus, arguably my most anticipated film of the year, is a visual and atmospheric triumph. Masterfully directed by Fede Álvarez, Romulus delivers a haunting blend of nostalgia and innovation, seamlessly bridging the gap between the classic Alien films and a modern cinematic vision. What truly elevates Romulus is it's dedication to deep focus cinematography, a rarity in today's blockbuster landscape where shallow depth of field often reigns supreme.Fede wanted DoP Galo Olivares to shot on the Alexa 35, a Super 35 digital camera which opts for a visual approach that allows every detail of Romulus' meticulously crafted world to shine. The deep focus cinematography immerses viewers in the rich, textured environments, making the production design an essential character in its own right. It's a breath of fresh air to see a modern film embrace practical effects and set design with such reverence, paying homage to the original Alien aesthetic while still feeling contemporary. With all it's cassette futurism, the film looks like it was genuinely plucked from the late 1970s. Yet the high-quality digital capture gives it an brilliant sharpness and clarity.The color grading is another standout aspect, with the palette evoking the cold, industrial feel of space while contrasting it with warm, ominous hues that hint at the lurking danger. The lighting expertly balances shadows and highlights to create a mood that is both foreboding and visually striking. Álvarez' love for the Alien franchise is evident in every frame, with countless references and callbacks woven into the set design, rewarding longtime fans with a treasure trove of Easter eggs.Score-wise, Romulus strikes a perfect balance between old and new. The score masterfully blends classic themes from the original Alien films with new compositions that enhance the film's suspense and atmosphere.Álvarez's directing skills really shine here, especially in how he builds tension and suspense throughout the narrative. The first 40 minutes are a masterclass in world-building and character introduction, setting the stage before diving headfirst into the horror. David Jonsson and Cailee Spaeny anchor the film, with Spaeny again delivering a nuanced and captivating performance that cements her as one of Hollywoods finest new talents. David Jonsson's portrayal of the android Andy stands out here and brings Romulus into the philosophical realm the Alien franchise is known for. Andy is a character that is both relatable and terrifying. Jonsson captures the duality of what it means to be almost human and confronts the age-old question of what truly makes us human, adding a layer of depth and tension to the narrative.As the film progresses, it shifts gears into full horror mode, delivering intense and memorable sequences throughout. The zero-gravity scene is a epic visual feast and the facehugger escape sequence that cuts back and forth with Isabela Merced' first Alien encounter is a heart-stopper moment. The Xenomorphs have never looked better, an immaculate synergy of practical effects and VFX.The introduction of the offspring alien is pure Álvarez - creative, shocking, and a bold evolution for the franchise. While it may stir some controversy, it's a move that feels both fresh and logical within the narrative's context, pushing the boundaries of what the Alien series can be.The film isn't without its minor flaws. The deepfake use of Ian Holm's android, while story-wise intriguing, doesn't match the high standards set by the rest of the film's effects. It's a rare misstep in an otherwise visually impeccable movie that detracts from the immersion. Additionally, a few one-liners pulled directly from the earlier Alien films felt a bit too on-the-nose, disrupting the film's otherwise natural dialogue.Alien: Romulus is a powerhouse of craft that beautifully marries the legacy of Ridley Scott's original with Fede Álvarez's unique vision. It's a love letter to the Alien franchise, yet it stands tall as its own entity, destined to become a classic in the years to come.9/10.",2024-08-29
232,vixescape,A love letter to the franchise,6,"The original ""Alien"" film is perhaps my favourite film of all time & as I was just 10 years old when it first hit the cinemas, I never had the joy of watching it on the big screen. However, I became a fan & watched all the Alien films so I awaited this movie with great trepidation & I must say it did not disappoint.Romulus has all the elements of all the Alien movies, all rolled into one. So much so, while I was watching it I was counting off which Alien movie inspired its particular scenes. & I must admit it was put together nicely. The only part of annoyance for me was the poorly done CGI facehuggers. They looked like little blobs with legs & not at all impressive. Saying this though I did like the CGI recreation of the very sadly missed Sir Ian Holm. Oddly though they managed to make his CIG face actually appear younger than he looked in the original film, which I found slightly odd. However I really did enjoy David Jonsson's portrayal of Andy the android. I have not seen this actor before, but I was so impressed with his skill in this movie, I shall be watching David Jonsson's career with great interest. Well done sir!All in all this is one of the better Alien franchise films, that was clearly made for the fans, & for it's better part it stuck quite lovingly to the cannon, but in my view it was let down by the limp & rather lazy CGI. This movie is hardly award winning stuff, but for fans like me it's just about as entertaining as as decent Alien film can get!",2024-09-22

237,writewheelpub,I enjoyed it but not as good as it might have been.,6,"Alien is one of the great films. I love the slow burning tension, building to peaks as the film goes along and then the final scene, which stunned me. I don't often see a film more than three times, but I've doubled that score with Alien, and I've seen material I'd missed each time. I gave it 9.Aliens was, excuse the pun, a different animal but still a classic. Alien 3 the director's cut was entertaining but a step down, Resurrection, a step up and the other two about level with 3. Romulus is more difficult to classify.I enjoyed it. It sucked you in from the start, and the lack of cheap shocks initially added to the excitement. Everyone must have guessed who would survive from an early stage. The two friends I went with agreed with me, which meant it lacked a little tension early on. There was minor character development; more than Aliens, just, but less than most of the franchise. It was a bit of a shame.I got confused at one stage, mainly about locations and directions, and later as to which space ship went where. Mind you, it didn't really matter. There were aliens and face-huggers to spare, so I left the analytical problems for the video.Irritations were few. The homage to various previous Alien films was unnecessary is the only irritation I can mention without including spoilers.For someone (like me) who has seen all the previous Alien films, Romulus is much as before, and no worse for it. It might have been a pleasant surprise to discover a different storyline, but then 3 might have put some backers off. It's a box-office cert as most people will get what they expect, so it'll be a success. And well deserving. The actors all took their parts well, with no one outstanding or poor; my idea of perfect casting.Go to see it. You will enjoy it. It doesn't set new standards for sci-fi, so not like Alien, and it doesn't equal the top couple of rungs in the franchise, but it's well produced, well acted, and there's a shock every few minutes after the establishing scenes.One point: those I went with thought the rings were poorly presented and not factual. However, the objects in the rings might well be only a metre or so away from each other, and will be travelling at a fair old clip.",2024-08-20

The music, the practical effects, the atmosphere, the isolation, the android, the pulse rifle.... Shall I continue. It really gave me that warm fuzzy feeling. The ability to tie ALL the films together was done really well. One other big point, Cailee Spaney, she will have a great career, her range of emotions throughout the film was impressive. Can't speak highly enough of her acting. Go in with high expectations and I don't think you will be disappointed. It's the best representation of the alien franchise since ""ALIENS""",2024-08-18

Alien did amazing things in those first movies, but the modern-day technological prowess accomplished so much to bring the world to life. Fantastic graphics combined with practical effects have once more built an incredibly horrifying world that feels desolate, cold, and dangerous as our ""heroes"" progress. The various forms of the aliens have fluid movements, with much more attention to detail that emphasizes the Xenomorph anatomy to higher degrees. Throw in solid technical effects of the station, and new ways to bend water and light to craft a flooded field, among other components and we have a winner when it comes to making the world feel realistic. A personal victory was paying enough attention to detail to not interrupt the graphics of the films that preceded them (a nice nerd touch). As for the carnage, yeah it's pretty vicious and right on point for the fans loving the immersion involved with visceral destruction.In regards to the tale, Alvarez surprised me with his way of blending the universe into a cohesive story that is familiar, but still a different take from Ripley's campaigns. Several characters have enough merit to attach to and root in hopes they survive the ordeal or at least pull off an awesome move. Their background stories have some depth, we have some tension, and it helps to flesh out the typical guys and girls who venture into the Xenomorph gauntlet. Good acting by some solid leads helps to sell the characters with Jonsson and Spaeny being my favorite in how well they take on their character's mannerisms and the chemistry they share with the others. Tough, vulnerable, emotional, and contained, it was a solid balance for me the likes of which I haven't seen in this franchise in a very long time. The actual plot has got some interesting angles, taking what seemed like a simple synopsis and conforming it into something that helps expand on the universe, pulling inspiration from several other films that play well to the lore. It incorporates good details and has that scientific premise the series has thrived on. Yet the science doesn't detract from the bout of survival that this movie is advertised as. Romulus has plenty of those classic Alien thrills as they do their best to accomplish their goals amidst the derelict space station. There are some decent action sequences, some thrilling scare components, and plenty of that Xenomorph finesse that the fanbase has grown to love. It's got a little bit of everything from several films that adds that homage factor a nerd like me loves.DISLIKES:PredictableMore Time With Several CharactersMore Of The Station Could Have Been SeenThe Ending's TwistThe Ending's Bloating Of The TimeA Few Plot StretchesSUMMARY:
However, the tale is not devoid of predictability, which thanks to the extensive advertising has resulted in a lot of the deaths and tales being very predictable. If you've avoided the scenes or forgotten the trailers you're in luck, but overexposure takes away part of the suspense that a series thrives on. In addition, I felt there was more to do with the characters, but several felt kind of shortchanged and reduced them to more fodder than meaningful characters. More action and suspense with the characters were welcome, alongside more time to see what else the station had to offer and potentially unveil more of the horror that would culminate in the big reveal. Yet the biggest limitation for me is the final twenty minutes and incorporating the twist into a final bout. Sure, it provided extra scares, a new adaptive structure, and several other facets I can't say to avoid ruining anything. Yet, I for one found it rushed, a bit awkward, and gross, a tad too much from the part of this franchise I'm not a fan of, and bloated the run time when there was a perfect stop point to launch from the next time. These moments are certainly memorable, but the execution felt a bit messy and crossed the line I had hoped to avoid.The VERDICT:
Alien Romulus accomplishes much of what I had hoped to see in the film. It returns to the origins but adds that splash of modernization to rev up the graphics and chaos present in the series. The carnage, the action, the thrills, and the horror have all come together in this film, and with a tale that has some more depth than I expected, it's a welcome addition that did beat most of the recent Alien films. True, the story is very predictable, the full utilization of everything and everyone still falls short, and I did not enjoy the final twenty minutes with the new twist. Yet, most of the film has accomplished a lot that gives me hope the Alien franchise may have more stories to tell in high-quality detail if given the same attention to detail as this one and Prey. Accounting for all of this, my scores for the movie are:Sci-Fi/Horror/Thriller: 8.0-8.5
Movie Overall: 7.0-7.5.",2024-08-16
240,Blimplarg,"Decent, exciting but could have been better/better edited",6,"I've enjoyed all of the Alien films (yep, including Alien V Predator and the Prometheus spin offs) so was looking forward to this. It was good, but could have been better. There's a fair level of tension and excitement and for those that like the Alien films, this is definitely with seeing.I appreciate the numerous references to other films in the franchise during this film, but think they were overdone - to the point they slightly undermined this contribution - a good story should have the legs to stand alone, and I think this film should have been allowed to try and do that.Not withstanding my first comment, Fede Alvarez, does a good job of keeping a level of authenticity to the feel and look of the early films, but the xenomorph is now becoming a bit predictable and familiar, so looses a bit of the dread involved.The script (not that important in a film like this), the plot and the characterisation are decent. The cast, generally, make a fist of the material they have. The exception to this is David Jonsson, who does a really good job of playing an android with an iffy personality.The editing isn't fab and, without giving anything away, the film either lasts too long, or the last part almost seems a predictable afterthought, and really could have been merged in to the film more smoothly, or missed off altogether.As I said at the start, this is a good, exciting film and worth seeing, but could have been better.",2024-08-19

The impressive sets and strong audiovisual presence create a tense environment that closely echoes the original Alien films, without entirely relying on nostalgia.While there are logical flaws and some ideas feel like direct nods to previous Alien movies, the blend of familiar elements and fresh approaches works remarkably well. Despite the shallow characters and a few predictable twists, the thrill remains consistently high, making this film an undeniably worthwhile cinema experience.A standout feature is the young lead actress, who delivers a compelling homage to the original 1979 protagonist, securing her place among the best in the franchise. Overall, ""Alien Romulus"" ranks among the series' top entries, exceeding expectations despite minor weaknesses. For fans of the genre and the Alien franchise, this film is an absolute must-see.",2024-08-16

Unfortunately, I was quite disappointed with a recent movie I watched. While it had some good moments, overall the story felt disjointed and didn't flow well. I think the attempt to create a character similar to Ripley from Alien fell short. Making the characters younger doesn't automatically make them wiser, and I think the story suffered as a result.All I know is that Remus can feed off of this energy. If you need help, I don't have director, character, or acting experience, but I believe I could have done a better job than this. I mean, it's not bad, but it just missed the mark. It started off as a great survival story among the youth, and then it fell into tropes. That's how I feel about what the movie could have been and should not have missed.What a phenomenal job by David. J.",2024-08-19

Hollywood this year is going strong with reboots in the world of horror with movies like first omen and this alienPlot wise is strong enough (even if not particularly original), and it's all so so well made (cinematography, direction, acting, soundtrack), that this alien Romulus leave you with a big smile and your heart filled, especially if you're an horror fan (some scenes are just stunning visually).And the silence space or the dark red corridors of the spaceships are just fantastic in IMAX (this movie demands Dolby cinema or IMAX where theyused the 1.90 aspect ratio for all the movie).

This had the potential of using every graphic stomach churning element and it fell short. Just another run of the mill Alien movie. I was hoping for raw unrelenting depictions of horror... now I'm not saying it was a bad movie. It's worth the watch if you love the alien franchise, but it lacked in excitement. Feels like it took forever for an alien even to show up on screen.Also... if you watch at home.

248,rafcity,Breathing New Life into an Overdone Genre,10,"Crafting a monster movie set in a confined space in 2024 is no easy feat, especially when that monster is an alien. That's the challenge Alien Romulus faces. Between 1980 and 2024, we've seen hundreds, if not thousands, of films in this genre. The real test for the producers was to deliver a fresh, engaging story that feels worth the ticket price, even with a premise that might seem overdone.And they succeeded. Alien Romulus is, without a doubt, the best movie I've seen this year. Ironically, the worst movie for me in 2024 is A Quiet Place, Day One. Both films belong to the same genre-alien monsters hunting down humans-but the execution couldn't be more different.I took my Gen Y child, who had no prior knowledge of the Alien series. Initially, they dismissed the film, thinking it would be just another predictable alien slasher. But after watching it, they admitted it was the best movie they've seen this year.Honestly, this is the first time I've left a movie with my adrenaline still pumping long after the credits rolled. The intensity lingered, and I could still feel the tension in my muscles as I sat there, glued to my seat. The entire audience was motionless until the very last credit, as if we were all expecting more. The film's score added to the intensity, making it feel like the story wasn't quite finished yet.",2024-08-16
249,hellholehorror,Best for a long time,8,"This is easily better than all the garbage Alien films that came after Alien³ (1992). It is a very worthy entry into the franchise. It has incredible production design inspired by the first two films. In fact everything technical and production wise is incredible, the music, sound design, cinematography, visual effects. Well actually the de-aging was really awkward but other than that. The film has great pacing with only a couple brief moments of downtime. What really drives this is the world that they create and the engaging characters. The acting is perfect too. The violence is suitably gross and certainly the goriest of the series without it being overbearing. The ending really is horrifically excellent. There are some really scary moments and the fear lasts after the movie ends. Now for the negatives, I didn't get why Rain didn't escape when she had the opportunity, Andy didn't seem a good enough reason as he was not the Andy she knew at that point. The aliens seemed too easy to kill, Rain did better than any of the colonial marines. Some of the fan service felt forced and unnecessary. I also didn't like that one alien that had electricity in his head, I know he got electrocuted earlier but still didn't make sense. Overall an excellent movie and I hope that they make more.",2024-10-29

But to the first point ... there may be some ... not so good CGI ... attached to that (again no pun intended) ... but since this plays between Alien and Aliens ... why not having something that will remind you of just that? I'd say it is more than just fan service ... it is enriching the Alien Legacy.To the point of slow burning ... well it has to establish the characters and to get us into the mood of the movie ... and the franchise. And talking of that ... I love the set design. Yes the music is amazing and the effects work wonders ... but the technology (the movie technology that is) fits in perfectly with the other movies. Why do I say that? Because sometimes movies that have been made many years after the initial movies ... make the originals look silly and out of time ... not just the ""new"" Star Wars movies (which are 20 years old now too) ... others have been guilty of that too.There is tension, there are other (visual and sound) throwbacks to other Alien movies ... and there you can tell Alvarez knows what he wants us to see ... and he is a fan of the franchise too ... if you need anyone to ""revive"" your franchise .. or just make another installment ... he is the go to guy!

However, I have to admit that they did a surprisingly good job this time. The plot is well-structured, and the tension builds naturally as the monster's appearance is eagerly awaited. While the main actress is undeniably talented, her role could have been more complex to truly compare with the iconic Ripley. Perhaps a more famous cast would have added extra impact. Nonetheless, this is the best movie in the franchise since Aliens. It may not be the sequel we all deserve, but it comes pretty close. Moreover, there's still a lot left to explore in this franchise, which has the potential to reach the same heights as Game of Thrones or The Walking Dead.",2024-08-16

Just a rehash of old ideas and cringeworthy use of lines from previous movies.One of the best things about the first two films in the franchise is that you had a decent cast. Here you just have a bunch of relatively unknown actors you have no empathy for. No wonder nobody of note signed up for this given the laughable script.Let me assure you, The Force Awakens and Rogue One, this is definitely not. Both of those are miles better than this.God only knows why Ridley Scott would put his name to this. Let's only hope it bombs at the box office so we can put an end to this franchise once and for all.",2024-08-21
254,drawlife,"Good, and really that's all it needed to be.",7,"I'm going to come at this film with two different perspectives. One as a fanboy who puts Ridley Scott's ALIEN and James Cameron's ALIENS in a high pedestal, but also a fan who has been disheartened by every other entry in the franchise, and one looking at the film as objectively as I can.With the exception of Isabela Merced, I appreciated how Fede Alvarez assembled a not so well known cast. No movie stars means we can disconnect from that celebrity and their fame, so it's more engaging in a genre like this. However, just for some reason I couldn't quite connect with any of the new cast. I didn't feel like they sold their performances. Caliee Spaney is the lead as Rain an orphaned miner and I just felt some of her delivery felt either forced or flat. Accompanying her is Andy, an android programmed by Rain's father to be her surrogate brother played by David Jonsson. Out of all the cast, Jonsson is the bright spot. Everyone else in the cast has that trope-like feel to their characterizations. But again because they're not too well known you kind of just forgive it a little.If you're a fan of the franchise it won't be hard to see that director Fede Alvarez is a fan who understands. Alvarez uses the much desired fan service in a way that which tells the story. So it's not fan service just cause, but fan service that has some point to the story. I couldn't help but smile when I saw the iconic M41A Pluse Rifle again and to see it in use in the setting it was brought me back to Cameron's ALIENS. The Xenomorphs also look and feel like the OG 79' Alien design aesthetically, but this is where Alvarez is smart cause it not only acts like Ridley Scott's ""Big Chap/Kane's Son,"" but when they're in hoards they totally act like a ""bug hive"" cocooning everything like Cameron's sequel. Bascially Alvarez combined the best of both worlds. He also did a call back to PROMETHEUS. I have less than positive feelings on Scott's last two ALIEN films, but I like how Alvarez did not just ignore it, I respect it because it's a part of canon.My issues with with the film is that the beginning is slow and because it's not hard to distinguish that mostly everyone but Cailee's character is fodder, it does come off slightly boring. It does take it's time setting up, but once it gets started, it starts off like Scott's ALIEN, but everything slowly dials up, feeling just a tad bit like Cameron's ALIENS by the end of it.Then the film does something new by the last act, distinguishing itself from a homage of the first two films, which will set it apart. It is an interesting idea to witness, but frankly to me that's were I felt it tried a bit too hard to bring something new to the table. I didn't hate it, but I didn't exactly love it either. How we get to this particular moment is when some leap of logic escapes a certain character's actions. For the most part the film does a good job where no character makes some really dumb mistake, and because of that it was just so off putting to see this happen, but I guess this is where the film eventually needed that dumb mistake so we get this surprise.If I'm going to get nit-picky, there were a couple of missed opportunities in certain moments. For example I thought the character Tyler played by Archie Renaux could have had a great moment in one particular scene and a few of the deaths I guess weren't as cool/gorey like I thought it would be.So objectively I think Alvarez overall does a good job reigniting some acid blood into the franchise that was sorely missing. Aside from a couple of missteps he pulls it off with care.As a fan, I'm pleased to see the obvious love letter to ALIEN and ALIENS, but at this point, I just wonder when are the studios going to stop making films that are either prequels or in-between stories and just move forward post Ripley. Or maybe give Sigourney Weaver/Clone Ripley from ALIEN RESURRECTION one last swan song before she gets too old. Before you fans come at me, for the record I don't like RESURRECTION, but I'm just tossing ideas and pointing out that RESURRECTION is chronologically the last film in the franchise and I'd like to maybe see some resolution and move forward after, especially since we haven't seen Ripley on screen since 1997 (I still cry over the cancelled Blomkamp ALIEN film). Mostly every other ALIEN film tries to emulate the original ALIEN, but as a fan who prefers Cameron's sequel I just really want to see the Colonial Marines on screen again, especially since they haven't been on screen since 1986. What I'm hoping for in the future is we get something like this. I think it's time to explore that avenue and move forward into the story should this do well, which I think it might. But for now this will do. Easily the third best ALIEN film.7/10.",2024-08-17
255,lassprite,Recombinant Monstrosity,9,"Alien Romulus delivers in intensity, body-horror and bizareness, although just like its predecessors it has flaws.It feels very much like a combination of every previous alien movie, all six of them (not counting the AvP movies), where they took various bits of DNA from all of them and recombined them into one new, strange organism, while still retaining some original angles.I didn't like some of the overt throwbacks, but the overall package was fantastic, and is definitely a worthy addition to the franchise.I must admit I was skeptical after seeing the trailer, but I ended up loving it.",2024-08-15
256,Jeremy_Urquhart,"It's very good, yet somehow also a little disappointing.",7,"I am almost certain Alien: Romulus won't stick with me, which makes me hesitant to give it a good rating overall. But it was fun. I wasn't bored. I was feeling like it would be kind of just another Alien film and it really was just another Alien film. It's better than some of the lesser entries and not as good as some of the best entries. It has very few surprises outside the final 20 minutes or so (and even then, it doesn't feel crazy in hindsight; just at the time), but it's entertaining enough.It's disappointing how few risks it takes, but I do think it extracts the best elements from past Alien films. As far as taking prior entries and throwing them all in a blender, and then presenting what comes out the other end as a new film, this is probably as good as it's going to get. If it's a sign of things to come, though, they'll really have to get a bit more adventurous next time around. Whoever oversees this series probably won't let that happen. There'll probably just be another one in six to eight years - just enough time to let people forget about Romulus. And I guess I did start this review by saying I'll probably forget about Romulus. Maybe they know exactly what they're doing.If you like the Alien series you will like Romulus (at least parts of it) and you will probably also feel disappointed at other points. It's fun in the moment and then it's kind of done. I don't think much of it has staying power. It's an odd piece of a machine I hope doesn't get too grotesque. The machine could definitely use some new parts, whenever there's another Alien film. I don't know who'll be in charge or what direction would be taken, but I'm ready for risk. There were chances to be weird here, sprinkled throughout, and they were almost never seized.But still, there's gooey, grisly, slimy fun to be had for those who know what they're in for and are okay with not the bare minimum, but the fair minimum. I didn't waste time or money, but I was still a bit hungry for something else or something more once it was over.",2024-08-20

As with a lot of modern films, I find this one a mixed bag, too content to revisit former glories rather than on contributing anything novel or indeed edge-cutting. There are some great elements here and some not-so-great elements, evenly distributed as the narrative unfolds. I do like Fede Alvarez who brings the same scene of visceral dread to this as he did to his EVIL DEAD remake, but I think he should have stuck to the direction as his script is disappointing. The characters are largely bland and the actors ho-hum, with the exception of the scene-stealing David Jonsson. There are some good set-pieces and scary moments littered throughout, but too often this merely reprises and restages earlier glories, vis a vis: the chestburster scene, the facehuggers in the lab, and the entire climax, which manages to copy bits variously from ALIEN, ALIENS and ALIEN: RESURRECTION, to lesser effect.",2024-09-27

The aesthetic and sets are brilliant. The nasty, slimy gore is spot on and I really can't fault the pacing or direction. The storyline is probably the only reason this movie doesn't get a 10 from me.

Much of this film is about references to previous films, and it all seems awkward. Characters move from one level to the next, as if in a video game, while the film bombards you with quotes and references to every entry in the franchise.

No need!!On the plus side I thought the special effects were quite good but overall I thought Alien: Romulus was something of a mess and I came out of the theatre a tad disappointed.

264,octagonproplex,If You'd Like a Tasty Zero Calorie Franchise Mashup...,7,"As an avid admirer of the Alien series on a whole, Alien: Romulus is aesthetically and viscerally accomplished with impressively evocative panache. The main two characters of the young woman Rain (Cailee Spaeny) and her adopted glitchy Wayland/Yutani Company discard ""brother"" Andy (David Jonsson) desperately attempting to literally flee corporate enslavement from a mining colony, are an original enough dynamic to invest in. It helps that both of those two young leads are superb actors as well, so even if nothing quite ever reaches the enraptured enthrallment we associate with Ellen Ripley's perilous journeys as embodied in Signorney Weaver's second-to-none performances - they do still succeed in embuing their characters with some interesting idiosyncracies worth observing in a fairly harrowing set-up of personal stakes. That's the good news to report. The other meat-walkers populating the story are basically the prerequisite trope fodder for inevitable demise in glorious gore gratuity - so not a lot of tricks up their sleeve except to be dispatched in order of apparent affinity with the leads and as per according to mechanical plot utility. Beyond that, we're essentially treated to a rather unfortunate overload of uniformity in franchise greatest-hits needle-drops, instead of inventing a unique setting to build upon or solution to play with from the fundamental sandbox premise confines of the series' dark corridors.I find tedious plot summerizations wholly unhelpful, when all that is required is to have a decently vague notion of where to place expectations according to the type and hype, or absence thereof. What need be known is that the last half of Romulus is a slapdash direct hodpodge of familiar iconic scenes that delineate Alien, Aliens, Alien 3, Alien: Resurrection, and Prometheus - like a cliff's notes supplement to the entire franchise. Ill advised reliance on what's already been done, in a missed opportunity for Romulus to carve out its own path in the Alien mythos.That said, I'm inclined to enjoy a good cover tune. So I liked Alien: Romulus - even though I still prefer all the the original quadrilogy entries better. Yes that means Alien: Resurrection is better in my opinion. And actually the least derivative installment in the series. I mean, there's no movie quite like it (well until now, kinda). And it's so bug nuts Metal Hurlant, that I have to love it for taking the established lore and doing its own twisted Jean-Pierre Jeunet thing with it! People STILL seriously sleeping on Resserrection's swagger! But anyway, Alien: Romulus is basically a Force Awakens member-berry level retread, which is what we all get when we whine about audacious takes (not ""subversive takes"", Last Jedi!) failing to deliever the cookie-cutter pastiche we think we crave - until we get that too, and feel all the more empty in retrospect.Prometheus had the right intention but failed because it thought it was smart and just flat-out wasn't. At all. Covenant, I found less cloying, in that respect at least. Despite Romulus being confidentally derivative, it's not condescendingly obnoxious, and therefore Romulus swims where Prometheus especially sank itself.Hey, I dig the vibe of Romulus... but I dug those vibes before. Curious case of franchise deja vu. So ultimately Romulus doesn't resonate due to lacking much of an identity of its own. It doesn't have the working-man elegance and unravelling suspense of Ridley Scott's original, nor the taught rollicking tension of James Cameron's expanded follow-up - but maybe Romulus' worst sin is wasted time frantically trying to unnecessarily tie itself to previous franchise lore convolutions which many might surmise robbed the series of its elegance and mystery, instead of shoring up the internal logic of its own premise conceits to function plausibly on the only terms that matter as a self contained story. However, if you can accept that it at least feels mostly dead-on correct, you can have good fun with it, and then all but completely forget about its existence immediately afterward.",2024-08-20
265,HorrorDisasterGuy-90617,Really great alien movie to the franchise,8,"I found this to be a great installment in the franchise. The story isn't the strongest with it being similar to the previous movies with a group going against the alien. There are a couple of plotlines in it, like Rook telling Andy over what to do and the reveal of it. But the movie is entertaining on how it pays homage to the alien franchise and tries to do its own things. I found the movie to be suspenseful with the characters trying to survive against the aliens and them coming up with plans to survive. It also does a great job of building up towards the aliens' appearance and fleshing out the characters. The climax itself is both suspenseful and unique on who is the final alien they go against. I found the characters to be done really well in this movie and contain great performances. The movie contains a lot of great practical effects to be found in it. I really like how they kept with the same alien design, and it looks great on how they kept it practical. Also, the facehuggers look great too on how they function and the work the filmmakers put into it. I also like the setting of the space station that looks amazing on the amount of details they put into it and the work they did to build the set. The movie contains pretty graphic death scenes that have great practical effects and also have chest bursting in it. There are also one more great practical effect in the movie, but no spoilers on what it is, but it looks impressive.Alien: Romulus doesn't beat the first movie, but it is still a great and fun movie to watch.",2024-08-16

This isn't satire. Nor is it a homage. 7. The deaths of the creatures get pretty boring. In fact, just about everything with the creatures gets boring. Did no one tell them that less is more. Look at the originals to see the results. FWIW - I rarely give a ""1"" as a rating.",2024-08-16
268,bogymel,Good reboot of the Alien franchise but not without flaws,7,"This movie succeeds in recreating the tense suspenseful amosphere of previous Alien movies and manages to keep you on the edge of your seat for the entire duration leaving you wanting more.However, it's not without issues, and some in my opinion are quite serious.If this is your first encounter with the Alien universe this will 100% make you want to watch everything, But if you're familiar with the othe rmovies, this one will leave you scratching your head a bit as it will soon become obvious that it has nothing original and it's just a remix of the previous movies. It's well written, but unoriginal.In complete opposition to the quality of the scenario are the characters. Poorly fleshed out and forgetable, I couldn't really care less who survived, I couldn't get attached to any of them they could all have been eaten impregnated or both by the creatures and wouldn't bat an eye.It also doesn't help that they got the actors from temu or something. It's good that they've given young actors a chance but there must be better ones out there. Unimpresive performances throughout, it feels like they blew the budget on effects and writers and couldn't get one single big name. This franchise deserves better!There is also some questionable CGI, it's only for a small part but it's too in your face to go unnoticed.Despite all that, I can't say that I disliked it, I actually thoroughly enjoyed it but I can't help feeling that this could have been so much more if characters were given a little more love and actors were selected better.",2024-10-29
269,avadava-39852,Loved this movie way more than I expected,9,"I personally thought it was awesome. The trailer seemed like it was giving away all the good parts so I was a little skeptical but boy was I wrong, there is a ton of craziness in this movie that I wasn't expecting!!The xenomorph was super well done, I'm happy they used actual special effects and props instead of CGI. The work really paid off! I really think this is one of the better Alien movies in the series.I felt like all the actors and actresses did fantastic, they played their parts well and in my opinion added a decent amount to the story even if they weren't the main focus of the movie.The movie super creepy and definitely gives you a sense of dread throughout. I was at the edge of my seat the whole time, and not just because space is already scary enough!I really reaaaaaally hope they make more movies based off of this one!! So awesome. Everyone in the theater seemed happy. There are obviously some faults but that's with any movie, all in all I was very happy and can't wait for it to come out on streaming so I can watch it again!",2024-08-17
270,cruise01,Fede Alvarez awesome take with the alien franchise.,10,"5 out of 5 stars.Alien Romulus is an awesome science fiction horror film that is a stand alone sequel in the franchise. While feeling like a reboot with catching the best parts of the original films. The film has that horror build up with characters going into a space station. Only to discover the face hugger aliens and being terrorized by the alien creature.Plot is great, characters savaging the space station to get cryopods. Only to get stuck there and fighting for there lives.Great cast ensemble with the main character being the heroine of the film.The direction is great. Fede Alvarez becoming a promising director which i think he ll be great at handling the resident evil game series.The film starts slow with a build up of characters and story. Once the terror kicks in. It does not stop until credits roll. It picks up and does not let you go. And the direction does not disappoint. The climax also crosses some boundaries that is creepy and terrifying.The music score is great with a hint of original score.Overall, it is an awesome film in the series and one of the best.",2024-08-17
271,xnicofingerx,and once again too many expectations,6,"Fede Alvarez, and thus the following card: a remake specialist with the promise of a good result, the best you can get out of a lack of new ideas. All right, if that's all there is to it, all the director still wants to stand for. But at least it could have been worse, see Exorcist and Halloween. Less anticipation is aroused by Civil War's tease.Anyway, here we go, and in the best possible way. A great look, we are actually back in the world of parts 1 and 2. The cast is less appealing, are they trying to lure young adults into the cinema by means of identification? We're back to the topic of annoyances, this time even plural. I'll tell you this much, nobody will be remembered for their charisma after the end of the film. All right, the 'artificial person' does a really good job. Thematically, the undertones critical of capitalism are taken up again, expanded to include the marginalisation of minorities. Well, it's 2024. And the target audience. Of course, everyone else is also tried to be picked up again, Facehugger check, Android 'Ash' fail. Phew, that looked really bad. There are also a few ideas of my own, especially regarding the alien genesis. Alvarez seems to watch too much porn. Or me, haha? No! Anyway, I saw both a penis and a vagina. I can't report much else exciting now, nothing really knocks your socks off. At the end, Alvarez gets to emphasise the horror in 'sci-fi horror' and it gets really wild and unsavoury. But again with a lot of potential to offend in the overall context. The rating is really difficult, the franchise tears you apart from two sides. As a neutral film, it wouldn't be bad, good genre fare, with some unattainable role models, the aftertaste becomes increasingly bland on closer inspection. Anyone who says 'flop' for part 4 or even part 3 should definitely not say 'top' here.",2024-08-14
272,adrianrhilge,Great movie,10,"""Alien Rombulus"" is an enthralling sci-fi masterpiece that seamlessly blends intense action with profound storytelling. The plot takes viewers on a riveting journey through a dystopian future where humanity's survival hinges on outsmarting a formidable alien race. The film's special effects are top-notch, creating a visually stunning experience. The characters are well-developed, and their emotional arcs are compelling. The climax is particularly noteworthy, featuring an alien that bore an uncanny resemblance to me, adding a personal touch to the thrilling finale. ""Alien Rombulus"" is a must-watch for sci-fi enthusiasts and action lovers alike.",2024-08-17
273,minoluund,Solid addition to the Alien franchise,7,"This alien will get a solid 6 out 10 on the Alien scale and 7 out of 10 as an overall movie.Some surprises here and there which did get me excited, however the movie is still pretty predictable and and the end results is the same as the other movies.The characters lacked depth except the main characters Rain and Andy, who did have SOME depth and backstory. The rest of them we barely get to know hence not letting us attaching ourselves to the characters and not really caring if they live or die.The movie introduced a new ""thing"" which looked awesome and felt terrifying. Like seeing the Xenomorph for the first time.Overall the movie did have a good pacing, not too fast or too slow. The fear felt real and the effects was on point. I must however warn every user that this Alien movie is the goriest and most graphic one out of them all.This Alien movie will be placed on the 3rd spot of every Alien movie released until this point. Only the 1st Alien and Prometheus is ahead of this movie.",2024-08-14
274,gavinp9,Very strong Alien story,7,"'Alien: Romulus' is the 9th 'Alien' film, and is technically the sequel to the original 1979 'Alien', chronologically falling between it and 'Aliens'. Thankfully, it takes lots of inspiration from both of those films and while not quite as great as them, comes closes in many respects. The film is called ""Romulus"", as that's the name of a space station our 6 main characters find abandoned, due to whatever experiments they were doing.A lot of this film working is due to it focusing only on 6 characters and giving them each a bit of time to become sympathetic to - Rain (Spaeny), android Andy (Jonsson), Tyler (Renaux), Kay (Merced), Bjorn (Fearn) and Navarro (Wu). How many will survive? Great silent/'Jurassic Park'-like start, then quick intro to these 6 characters, then they're on the ""Romulus"" and the face-huggers are skittering everywhere - great stuff!There's some good tense moments, a few jump scares, a familiar face, a truly-disturbing xenomorph at the end and a strong score. I was very impressed with the visuals/CGI of the planet and it's Saturn-like rings and how they were used to bring urgency to the final act. It's probably 15min too long overall, with some head-making decisions towards the end. But is has a strong cast with Rain not being too much like Ripley, and the xenomorph not being too powerful, but nor easy-to-kill - still always great to see emerging from the shadows! Does well to fit into the overall 'Alien' storyline and is exciting enough as a standalone sci-fi film.",2024-08-20
275,nbabineau-70537,About as good as it could be... for what it is.,9,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film, but a part of me is left extremely disappointed. Not by the quality of the film, it was great, but by the state of the franchise. This movie doesn't know what it's trying to be. It's not a proper reboot, as it doesn't appear to be the start of anything interesting. It's not really a sequel to anything, either. You can't really consider it to be a direct follow up to Alien, despite its place on the timeline, and it isn't a true continuation of Ridley Scott's prequel films, either. It's a one-off cash grab that was perfectly positioned between the two films that would give it the most opportunity for fanservice.That being said, I loved it. I've been skeptical ever since finding out that it would have nothing to do with the previous two films, but my expectations were blown out of the water. Not only does it acknowledge those films, but it does so in an original and interesting way. It's true that I probably would have enjoyed it even more if it had just been the third film in David's story, but at least there are still Alien films being made, and good ones at that.Yet, I can't help but wonder if this is the beginning of the end, like The Mandalorian was for Star Wars, or what Avengers: Endgame was for Marvel. Both solid entries into their respective franchises, but what came after each was a sleu of never ending mediocre content. Here's hoping Alien: Earth doesn't continue that trend for Alien.",2024-08-15
276,donovand-19344,True to source,9,NOTE: I enjoy a fun movie experience and refuse to pick a movie to death. I choose to enjoy the experience without too much criticism so take this review from an optimistic position.This movie is true to the alien franchise and does it justice when several have not. The effort to be accurate to the source was appreciated even if a little on the nose sometimes.I appreciated it even if it had cliche storylines at times and predictability. There are great Easter eggs for the fans but the story stands enough on its own to be enjoyable for new fans.I wish they had taken time for greater character development but it was fun with some great acting and some pretty good frights. Most of the oddities are true to the franchise as well but I won't say more to avoid spoilers.,2024-08-16
277,Her-Excellency,"Much Hype, Little Bang",7,"We were SO excited when we heard about this film and more so, when we saw the first trailer. Counting down to it was almost torture. I mean ... the Alien franchise, is iconic - despite some missteps. This was THE next must-see film on our list!And so, with almost break-the-bank loads of popcorn, hot dogs, and drinks in hand, we waited with bated breath, to be mind-blown-out-of-an-airlock. ... Sadly, though, that did not happen.The beginning of Aliens Romulus is downright boring. WHEN have the Alien movies started off boring and remained boring for very long? Not before this. So much exposition for what could have been explained in five minutes, did not bode well. It's almost as if this movie script started off as a different movie altogether, and then someone said, ""Oh, let's make the aliens part of THE Aliens universe!"" And so, about thirty minutes or more into it, is when you start seeing hints of the slimy, acidic, face-hugging world Ridley Scott first brought us. It's at that point that it slowly picks up and there are some really good scenes - as well as some scenes we've seen before.All in all, it has been done better.One thing, or rather, person, who stood out, is David Jonsson as Andy. He delivered an amazing performance, and mark my words, he'll be in high demand after this.",2024-08-16
278,fletcherw928,Absolutely savage.,9,"I was really impressed walking away from this movie and it's the most fun I've had with an Alien movie since the very first two films by Ridley Scott and James Cameron. It definitely got the feel and tone right from those films in particular and I was impressed of just how good the set and production design was in this which felt exactly like it was in Alien, with several of the scenes taking inspiration from Aliens aswell.At first, I thought this was going to be just a retread of everything we have already seen when it comes to this franchise, but I was pleasantly surprised of the amount of original ideas this movie pulled off, especially a particularly shocking twist at the very end that I won't spoil, but I was amazed of how disturbingly unhinged it was and I welcome it.The film wasn't as perfectly directed as those first two classic films were and at times it is noticeable that the camerawork and direction isn't as great as Cameron's or Ridley Scott's but it is in no way bad. It's still very good and creative with some really good tension building up in the first act in this movie and some really scary and suspenseful scenes.Overall, I had a really good time with this movie and I needed a quality Sci-Fi flick to was the bad taste of the awful Borderlands movie I decided to see last week. Don't waste your money on that move. This is far more worth your time and should please any Sci-Fi horror fan.",2024-08-16

I'm not too much, particularly because I think the Engineers are goofy, so I was disappointed to see that as part of this Alien film. I actually wish it had been even more retro and been a more hardcore sequel connecting Alien and Aliens.It also really doesn't embrace it's R-rating, which is a huge missed opportunity. There is very little gore, and the kills aren't actually that original, derivative of previous Alien movies and even Prometheus.But it is still a decent Alien film, and it's much better than Alien: Covenant. I think it's also better than Prometheus and, of course, Alien 3.",2024-08-16

281,mistela67,An unexpected delight,7,"Alien: Romulus was a movie I decided to go see actually when I was bored, and the summer was almost over. I really didn't expect much from it, but I will tell you, it's a hidden gem of a movie!I was a bit skeptical when I saw the Millennium-aged cast, and even now, none of the actors can hold a candle to what Ripley did. But, that being said, the dialog wasn't cringeworthy typical, and the pace and direction were spot on.It takes a bit to get going, but that's okay because even in the build up, I never truly lost interest. This version definitely borrowed from previous versions, including a token mimic shot of the new heroine posing, armed and ready, just like Ripley once did. There were other tributes to the older movies, if you were able to pick them out. As a franchise fan, I did, and I appreciated them.I was especially happy to finally see the 'creature' at the end. I won't give away what it was, but it was something I've been waiting to see for some time. After it appeared, it was a bit of a letdown, I guess, that doesn't take away from my pleasure in finally seeing one.All in all, Alien: Romulus was an unexpected pleasure, a fun film with some great moments, and a noteworthy addition to the franchise.7/10 - just an overall fun movie.",2024-08-20
282,anogarapena,"Really lame writing, downgrading even more the Alien franchise",3,"Another pure action movie with absolutely no plot and very lame writing. Everything happens in the span of less than an hour. There is no character development, barely any dialogue.Also, full of things that make no sense, even within the alien universe. People say that it is full of winks to previous aliens movies: more like poorly stealing ideas from them, not connecting them in a plot like manner.Some good visual effects, i'll give you that. But you just go all the movie couldn't caring less of all the characters.An autoaim gun takes all the credit for the major action scene, with an unexperienced young woman killing most of the aliens using it. Also, all the fuzz about the scene with aliens' acid blood not harming the sheep because of no gravity: liquid with no gravity takes spherical shape.

Stick to the things that work in the previous films while finding new gems that excite the fan base. This did something that movies like ""The Force Awakens"" couldn't. There will probably be sticklers out there who don't like change, but this movie keeps a familiar equation with exciting and new variables. I am on the edge of my seat with the question ""What comes next?"", and to me, that is exactly what I needed from this film. I love these movies and acknowledge how difficult it is to make a fresh and respctable movie in this franchise. The only reason this is not a 10/10 for me is because I am saving it for this hopeful trilogy's ""Empire Strikes Back"". Alvarez take a BOW!",2024-08-16
284,harshathebale,Mind Blown,7,"I think ""Alien: Romulus"" is a redemption for the Alien series. This movie started as a regular movie but half an hour later it brought back the old essence of watching Alien movies for the first time. There is less drama but more action scenes never seen before in a space movie. I was on the edge of my seat for every minute in the second half. This movie brings back the hope. I want to see more of this series, especially Alien World which has the most exposure in this movie than the others.But there are also some cons in the first half. It felt like a formulated movie with a pregnant woman, lovers, and an immature guy in the group. Excluding that I think this could be one of best Alien films. The movie also felt short but it did not disappoint when it came to suspense and adrenaline rush.",2024-08-23

It's cool to see all the Easter eggs and tie ins.The plot itself was your typical alien movie, fast paced, claustrophobic, and ominous. They tie in the story to elements of Prometheus and Covenant, which makes for a very exciting, and creepy final boss so to speak.Definitely for fans of the franchise but easily could be enjoyed by a first time viewer.",2024-08-22

The majority of this movie was absolutely excellent! About an hour into it I sincerely thought that I was gonna walk out of the theater thinking it may very well be my favorite Alien movie. The acting, the thrills, the directing, the story, I was enjoying it all and still think it was executed beautifully, until the last 20 minutes or so. My huge problem is that the last 20 minutes looked ridiculously stupid. I could not believe and I can not believe, that they made the movie that they made and then crapped out at the end with what looked like low budget garbage. The movie could have stop about 20 minutes before it actually does and it would have been a 9 star. They didn't need the last 20 minutes but if they just had to out it in there, then they should have had way way way better effects. Completely disappointing. I almost feel like it disrespected the entire movie up to that point. What in the world were they thinking? Who said 'Yeah, this looks great!""? Worth watching but not the ending.",2024-08-22
288,JohnnyMercury,"Well-Made and Entertaining, But Felt Derivative",7,"I saw this in IMAX and it looked and sounded great. The craftsmanship behind the camera is well-done and was nice seeing a lot of practical effects. Saying that, the film comes off like watching ""Alien/Aliens Greatest Hits"" - Not Performed By Original Artists, right down to the one-liners, member berries, and shot construction. Maybe that was their intent? It didn't work for me personally, but did enjoy the film overall.If the film wasn't so technically well made, excellent acting by the two leads, and (mostly) entertaining I'd rate it 6.5.

While it initially sparks excitement, the film seems unsure of what it wants to achieve. It fails to capture the tension and atmosphere of the Alien legacy, feeling like a two-hour void rather than a gripping story. Neither the characters nor the plot are developed with any depth. Unlike its predecessors, this movie lacks the immersive moments of fear and suspense, instead delivering mundane scenes. Furthermore, it offers nothing new or intriguing to the established universe. It's clear the production team didn't put enough effort into creating a satisfying narrative for the audience. The iconic elements of the Alien series are, unfortunately, used superficially and in a disjointed manner.

Definitely will not recommend the movie to anyone. It starts slow with same old principles. Should have increased the role of synthetics & evolved microorganisms.

291,johnalagoz,"Don't listen to any critic, this is a mind-blowing cinematic experience.",8,"Alien Romulus: is a 2024 sci-fi horror prequel which is set place between Alien (1979) and Aliens (1986) and consists of a crew made up of 6 trying to get out of their mining planet, which leads them to escape on their ship. But they decide to board a mysterious ship that leads them to their inevitable doom.Torn between most movies of the franchise, what makes Alien Romulus so unique is it's characters that don't rely on some sort of backstory or previous installment to understand them, which what Prometheus (2012) and Alien: Covenant (2017) fails to deliver not only that aspect, but many other drawn out things I have discussed on their reviews. Character-wise, this film doesn't disappoint and I can most certainly say that these are the best developed characters since Alien 3 (1992) which I consider to be an impressive achievement over that long period of time.This is spoiler free, so I cannot go to deep on most areas, however some of the cinematography and CGI for the ships and planets are nothing short of jaw-dropping. You just have to see this for yourself with hidden cameos and clever plotlines sprinkled throughout.Overall, Romulus combines all features from the saga to one big spectacle that not only delivers storywise, but successfully cements the cast as versatile and hugely impactful actors that make the heart of the Alien films all so memorable, and deserves the title of the best alien film since Aliens.Grade: A+",2024-08-16
292,barathbushan,Decent movie plays a nice homage for its Ancestor from 1979,6,"The story starts on a Wayland Corp mining outpost planet, with a bunch of youngsters wanting to salvage a ship to move to a planet with a Sun. Guess what shows up unexpectedly on orbit ! This movie explores this plot. An overall enjoyable experience, with a few set backs. Some of the home runs we have in this movie is the homage paid to the OG movie. If your a fan of the original, this is a must see just for this one reason alone. The CGI & Cinematography is top notch, nothing short of what you'd expect at this Budget. My favorite special effects part is where the ship/station eats the dust the asteroid belt in all its glory towards the end. The action sequence is perfectly dialed in, with some never seen before truly innovative ""gravity moves"". The star of the show is the grotesque scene at the end, which is the only crowning moment about this movie. The story is ok and passable, nothing philosophical or higher thinking subject matter going on here or any lore explored, just a dumb downed shoot em & run for your life weekend flick. Some of the things that are lost on me are the Plot Armor the main lead has, and some Alien's acting out out of character. The Android Andy here has some weird performance here, with the constant frowny puppy dog look he has for the entirety of the movie that gets old and annoying, but the bond he shares with Raine comes across as genuine. While in older Alien(s) seasoned marines got souped in an instant, there seems to be a lot of ""getting away"" from the face huggers quite easily. This is really new for an alien movie , and as fan of this franchise the plot armor a bunch of these teenagers have gained is not quite acceptable at the expense of nerfed face huggers. Overall this is an average movie which pays a nice tribute to the original at the cost of its own originality. I loved the action when I was in the movie, but an hour later the whole thing was lost on me devoid of any questions, expectations or anticipation.",2024-08-20

Easily the best in the franchise outside of the first two.

The concepts of the corporate machine using humans, and the proliferation of uncaring AI all the eventual victims of the bloodthirsty aliens is almost perfectly written and acted out. Now we just need a movie that describes the motives of the engineers, plus it's just a fun film for the ungeeky. There are 2 moments in the film where the writing could have been a bit better, but overall fantastically acted, and directed. If you're coming into the series new, which isn't the case prolly, you should minimally watch aliens and Prometheus since this film directly ties the two together.",2024-08-16
295,brandondaniels-89236,It's Alien the way it should be.,9,"Little back story. Love Alien and Aliens. Rest of the series has been either a hit or miss. The last few Prometheus is decent and Alien Covenant for me is one of the worst alien movies ever. Where Covenant does wrong Romulus does right.Romulus checks all the boxes needed for a good Alien movie. Characters that aren't completely stupid, Weyland of course being Weyland, Androids being very interesting, The Facehuggers and Xenomorphs all look good, and plenty of great moments that are scary. Movie is long at 2 hours and 30 minutes but watching the film it really doesn't feel that long. After all the character building in the beginning of the film the movie really engages and keeps your attention. If I had to knit-pick anything some acting can be over the top at times. With that said some actors really do shine over others. Of course it's not better than the originals but it's for sure much better than the last one. 8/10 highly recommend for a good time.",2024-08-18
296,twocents2,No Rom No Com Yes Suspense,7,"I liked this a lot better than I thought. I sneaked into the multiplex screening, so I entered at midpoint and had to stick around to watch the first half. The benefits employee of the evil corporation that Rain and her friends work for has diabolically doubled her work hour requirements with a few keyboard clicks, so she cannot leave Jackson's Star for Yvaga III and finally see the sun. Her friends are also held hostage in an eternal limbo in this depressing dystopia. The whole cast should really have been older, but Hollywood wants to get the teen demographic and they work very cheap. This neophyte crew decides to hijack a ship and get to a floating space station where they can get pods enabling the nine year ride to the promised land. Of course, this place is riddled with booby traps, the familiar face huggers. Rain is partnered up with the family android, Andy, played by David Jonsson. What else would he be called? He's supposed to solely protect her, until he's programmed with other orders for a while. His British accent was so annoying. The exposition is pretty decent for a while, holding us until the real action kicks in. Rain's BFF is of course pregnant POC Kay, which we learn early, and we can guess what the spawn will look like. It's an Exorcist vibe in the middle of an Alien franchise film. All we really don't know is the order in which the supporting cast dies. We know the last one standing from jump street. Aileen Wu as the bald badass Navarro was pretty interesting. The classical Remus and Romulus dichotomy is supposed to be a classy, clever detail. But it was lost on me and probably 99% of the audience. They ultimately didn't make enough of a big deal about it, despite it being in the title. Ian Holm as the corporate bad guy on a computer screen was standard issue villain. Cailee Spaeny is okay in the lead role. She's the polar opposite from Sigourney Weaver, very understated, frustrated yet determined. The guns are great, and the huge space station is a great playground for the director and his crew. Bottom line is that this will make big money and everybody will get paid. Spaeny gets even more visibility after her title role in Priscilla. I enjoyed it and expect big crowds now that Deadpool and Twisters are finally starting to fade.",2024-08-20
297,tremblas,Where are the adults????,1,Another children movie. Where are the adults? I am so tired of theses children movies. Who cares about kids with billions dollars equipment. Who gave them all this technology? I really don't care who dies or lives between theses people without any personnalities. Where are the scientists? They are high school students! It looks like a high school play. There is no suspense. Compare with the original Alien. This was realistic. They were real adults. Not stupid teenagers. Is this Scream 8? Put real actors and real people and you will have a movie. I had enough after 15 minutes. This the worst Alien movie ever!,2024-11-06
298,madhuraansingkar,Outdone most of the Alien franchise,9,"I don't write reviews, but this movie compelled to write my first one. What a refreshing cinema after a long long time! Simply outstanding!! No drama, no emotional pasts, no unnecessary characters or their developmental storylines. To the point, great jump scares, incredible cinematography, super engaging and amazing actors. It is as good as the first part. Must watch! I am very choosy with the content but this by far beats most recent movies. Cant wait for the next one in the series.. oh yes they keep you waiting for more. This film is a masterpiece that will leave you on the edge of your seat. It redefines the horror genre with its originality and sheer brilliance. Do not miss it!",2024-08-18
299,RMurray847,A worthy entry,7,"The world most certainly did not need another ALIEN movie, and yet, I've discovered that ""ALIEN"" must be some kind of siren call for me. I'm old enough to have been around for the original ALIEN, and I saw all its sequels in movie theaters, usually opening weekend. Apparently, I'm a bit of a sucker for a simplistically brutal story, whether told by Ridley Scott, David Fincher (the least successful of the bunch) or James Cameron (whose take is the one I watch the most). Now, add horror director Fede Alvarez to the mix. He built it, and I did go.So, let's just get this clear. This is not a great movie. But ALIEN: ROMULUS is a very solid entry in the series, and had much to admire. It certainly also has weaknesses, but when the closing credits began, I felt I had been well entertained. Just a gut reaction, which really is what this sort of film is all about. Getting you in the gut. You either happily go along for the ride, or you wonder what you're doing wasting two hours of your life.ALIEN: ROMULUS (from now on, just ROMULUS) begins with an quick opening segment showing the giant space craft Romulus & Remus collecting a giant ""rock"" sample from some space wreckage. The wreckage happens to be from the Nostromo, which ALIEN fans will recall was that original film's spacecraft. Where we first got to experience the xenomorph and its sharp, pointy teeth, acid blood and unfortunate breeding methods. This rock, they believe, has a dead monster in it. The ship heads back into deep space, ready to begin its exploration of the creature they've brought on board.Jump ahead some time (and space) to a mining planet that literally never sees daylight, and we meet Rain and her gentle, thoughtful and possibly slightly ""off"" friend Andy. Rain has put in her required 12,000 hours of work and we meet her as she eagerly goes to what passes for an HR office to ask for her transfer off-planet. She's told there is a worker shortage, and her contract has been increased to 24,000 hours. It clicks pretty fast for Rain that she's essentially enslaved on this absolutely horrible planet (no daylight, lots of mud and uneducated jerks everywhere). So she is in the right mood to go along with her boyfriend Tyler's plan to take a ship, fly up to a derelict spaceship hovering in orbit (but merely 36 hours from hitting the planet's rings and being destroyed), grab some of its cryo-tubes (you know, to allow for years of suspended animation) and fly on to a planet 9 years away, that offers a respite and sunlight. Tyler's sister Kay, as well as a couple of friends (Bjorn and Navarro) join in on the ride. They're all young people, full of energy and maybe not so much good sense. It's an adventure for them, and it's a very understandable grab for a better life.Well, you guessed it...the ship turns out to be the Romulus and Remus, and I'll bet you also guessed that the xenomorph was not, in fact, dead. And maybe even that the experiments scientists conducted before meeting their doom where not all that wise.The small group docks with the much, much larger space station and begin their salvage efforts. But were it not for those pesky aliens, they would have succeeded in their quest. But, this is ALIEN: ROMULUS afterall, and they are in for quite a lesson in jumping to poorly thought-out plans.Rain is played by Cailee Spaeny (PRISCILLA & CIVIC WAR). She's had quite a last year or so, and this was the perfect movie for her young career. Much like Sigourney Weaver did 45 years ago, Spaeny gets to show us a tough, resourceful, fast-thinking but empathetic character. She's an action hero both tough and vulnerable (she's a small young lady who looks even younger than her 25 years). She gets to kick *ss! She is also, quite frankly, the only human character with much character development at all. She's strong enough to take us through this adventure rooting for her and urging her on.And that's good, because the other performers (with the exception of David Jonsson as Andy, who has his own interesting acting opportunities) are just about as generic as they come. The ALIEN films often have thin characterizations, but ROMULUS may have the most flimsy of all. I think back on Bill Paxton in ALIENS or even the generic actor Logan Marshall-Green being generic in PROMETHEUS, and they look practically Shakespearean compared to ROMULUS's offerings of alien fodder.But, think back on director Alvarez's other films. THE EVIL DEAD starred a fantastically tough Jane Levy and then mostly a bevy of generic young actors. The deeply creepy and effective DON'T BREATHE again featured Levy as a tough but vulnerable young lady, accompanied by a bunch of very stock young actors. (To be fair, it also featured Stephen Lang unforgettably as the monster of the piece). I think Alvarez is only interested in these other characters as not just fodder for the baddies, but as something against which his leading ladies can react. We experience their deaths often through the eyes of the lead character. I don't know if this is a deliberate choice (and Alvarez writes or co-writes these films as well), or a directorial blind spot. His focus is so tight on his lead. And putting that lead through increasingly stressful and icky situations. Fortunately, he does so EXTREMELY effectively. Alvarez can build a nice action sequence, but he understands even better the power of dread. Not just dreading something happening, but dreading that it will happen in an icky and painful way.In ROMULUS, he comes up with a few new spins on just how the xenomorphs can dispatch their prey. And towards the end, we meet a variation that's just so...WRONG...on so many levels that we can't help but shudder. Yes, it's a creature that can kill...but it's a creature that shouldn't exist. Alvarez wrings fun from the film by not so much re-inventing the wheel as running that wheel over its victims in new and creative ways. High art, this is NOT! But it does get the heart pumping, and I heard more than one person talking back to the screen at time. To me, that's a sign that the movie, despite any storytelling or characterization shortcomings, has gripped its audience and dragged them along for the ride.I'll also note that there are some cool visuals here. The scenes featuring the rings around this mining planet are just lovely to look at.Finally, for fans of the series, a ""fan favorite"" makes a return of sorts and plays a big part in the outcome of the proceedings. I won't say more, because I want you to be as pleasantly surprised as I was.Just put aside your wariness, and put aside the ""literary"" side of yourself, and immerse in the fun, gross, loud and gripping world of ALIEN: ROMULUS.",2024-08-19

It's from Master Of Horror, Fede Alvarez who is the genius behind the Evil Dead Remake and the Don't Breathe films... This movie is set between Alien (1979) and Aliens (1986)... It stars Cailee Spaeny, David Jonnson, Archie Renaux, Isabela Merced, Spike Fearn and Aileen Wu... My God, this sequel is filled with mind-blowing realistic special effects... It's definitely one of the best films in the Alien franchise... I feel it's up there with the first 4 Alien films with Sigourney Weaver...

301,Pairic,Back On Form! Rain Is The New Ripley!,9,"Alien: Romulus: Back on form as Rain (Cailee Spaeny) shouts Die M******er! When she confronts an Adult Alien. I wonder if Space Monsters can hear you Scream. This is a dark, gritty SF/Horror film. Rain was exploited as child labour just as her now deceased parents were and arbitrarily has her contract extended by Weyland-Yutani corporation. She lives with her ""brother"" Andy (David Jonsson) a damaged synthetic on a mining world where the sun don't shine orbiting Jackson's Star. So iserable it reminded of the rainy Limerick in Angela's Ashes. She links up with a bunch of misfits who have an old orbiter, they detect what looks like a damaged starship but turns out to be a derelict space station. Once they dock with it the fun starts. First stage Xenomorphs are in cryostasis but these mini-morphs are soon loose and hugging faces. You get the chestbusting and pulse rifles along with chases through tunnels and vents but Director Fede Alvarez puts his own stamp in this film, an interquel set between Alien and Aliens. The tension is well maintained and when we finally see an adult Xenomorph there is a kind of shock and awe. The mini-morphs pursuing people through crawl space is suitably terrifying. We get the return of Ian Holm (via CGI) as a badly damaged science officer model synthetic. This is a savage film which pays homage to its predecessors and is not for the squeamish or faint of heart. Inspiring performances by Spaeny (who is likely to be the ""new Ripley"") and David Jonsson. The spacecraft and station designs were suitably retro, switches and buttons, old style screens and graphics. The true feel of Alien, the spirit of Giger lives on in the production design. Directed by Fede Álvarez, who co-wrote it with Rodo Sayagues. 8.5/10.",2024-08-15
302,kczgqwb,In Need of Adult Supervision,1,"Ever take a day off of school? If so, you might relate to this film as it too had no class. The entire cast appears to be near or deeply under the age of 30 which gives the movie a teenage horror film vibe. Yet all of these people also happen to be incredibly competent at high-tech ""space stuff"" which gives the film a ridiculous vibe. The casting is nice and diverse with the mandatory White female heroine paired with a Black male counterpart which she is uniquely bound to. Of note, whenever this duo is introduced into a movie the casting crew always makes certain to never include a Black female anywhere near the assemble, as presumably this subconsciously threatens the authority and the sanctuary of the relationship between the White female and Black male. All and all the film is completely hollow, profoundly childish and a deep insult to even the worst of the previous films in the franchise.",2024-08-16
303,southdavid,Alien: Sisyphus,6,"I'm struggling with this review, as I don't know quite how passionately I want to get after the points I want to make. I suppose the options when making a sequel are either take a big swing, and then either hit or miss wildly depending on how well you do, or safely retread what we've seen before so it is essentially just ""more"". I'd favour the former every time, but Romulus is definitely the latter.On a mining colony on LV_410, a group of young adults, having seen the toll the work took shortening their parents' lives, decide to leave. They've learned of an abandoned Weyland-Yutani ship, in orbit above the planet and plan to break in and steal the statis chambers, then embark on the 9-year journey to Yvaga. On arrival they discover that the ship was, in fact, a scientific research station. Whilst trying to recover fuel for the chambers, they inadvertently awaken the research material; a series of alien organisms, created from a cloned version of an original xenomorph recovered in the wake of the destruction of the USCSS Nostromo.So, I will start by saying technically the film is very good. The aliens, often practical effects, work really well. The CGI space landscapes, vehicles and ships also look really good. The performances from a young, and largely British, cast are strong - even those who are clearly here only to die in horrible ways.The trouble is, it's in service of a story that is largely a rehash of the first ""Alien"" film, with a little of ""Aliens"" mixed in and, obviously, it's an inferior version of the film than the original was. If you're going to keep making films in this series, they really need a new take, to justify its existence and this does not have one. With the possibly exception of the playing with the gravity in this one, it's very similar to what we've seen before. The most controversial element was attempting to use Ian Holm's likeness for an android, similar to the one he played in Aliens. It never worked for me, and every time I saw it all I could think about was that the effect, for all the effort that went into it, wasn't very convincing. Personally, I'd have thrown all that development money at Michael Fassbender.Having said all that. I didn't hate ""Alien: Romulus"" but it's an inessential addition to the series.",2024-09-09
304,MrDHWong,Sure to please newcomers and fans of the first two films,8,"""Alien: Romulus"" is the seventh film in the ""Alien"" sci-fi action horror franchise (or ninth if you count both ""Alien Vs. Predator"" films). Directed and co-written by Fede Álvarez (""Evil Dead"", ""Don't Breathe"") and starring Cailee Spaeny in the lead role, it worthily stands as a solid entry in the long running sci-fi series that is sure to please newcomers and fans of the first two films.Sometime between the events of ""Alien"" and ""Aliens"", a group of space colonists led by Rain Carradine (Cailee Spaeny) are tasked with scavenging the long abandoned Weyland-Yutani space station ""Renaissance"". Upon arriving, the colonists discover that the Renaissance is in an increasingly dilapidated state, giving them only 36 hours until it eventually collides with the rings of a nearby planet. Salvaging what they can within the limited timeframe, the crew's mission is further hampered by the infestation of a large nest of Xenomorph eggs that quickly hatch to find any appropriate hosts. Realising the danger these lifeforms pose, Rain and the rest of her team decide to withdraw from their mission and try to escape the space station before it is too late.After its debut in 1979, the ""Alien"" franchise has gone on to become one of the most successful sci-fi franchises in history. Thanks in part to its clever blending of science fiction with elements of both horror and action, the series remains a favourite among many aficionados of each of these genres. Over the course of various feature films, books, and video games, the franchise has also carved out a rather intricately structured universe that has helped it endure on for this long, primarily due to the menacing presence of its antagonistic extraterrestrials known as Xenomorphs. The story continues in ""Alien: Romulus"", a standalone interquel film that successfully harkens back to its horror roots without requiring too much prior knowledge of either previous or later installments.Mirroring the film that started it all, this one uses the limited confines of its main location to establish the frightening events that are set to follow. After the crew of young colonists first board the destitute Renaissance, they are greeted by the unsettling sight of destroyed equipment, large holes burned through the metal floors, and important machinery that has been mysteriously switched off. To make matters worse, the team soon learn that they are not alone on this space station as previously thought when they discover the hallways are littered with large eggs containing numerous facehugger Xenomorphs. Once these eggs hatch, the crew now have to contend with the prospect of becoming incubators for these terrifying creatures, which is made even more difficult for them due to the narrow interior of this space station. Although this may sound like the film is simply rehashing the basic premise of the original, there are plenty of other new elements to appreciate that help it stand out on its own.As a way to give his film a more distinct look, director Fede Álvarez uses the appropriate shades of colour to set the mood of a particular scene, with red being the most prominently shown. Though the most obvious reason here could be to signify blood, red can also be used to represent the sheer strength of the Xenomorphs versus the otherwise weak fleshly humans. This crew is clearly outmatched and outnumbered, with grave danger awaiting anyone unlucky enough to cross paths with even just one of these perfect killing machines. The audience needs to be reminded of what the Xenomorphs are capable of, and the simple use of a colour like red effectively does the job without them even realising it.In keeping with the style of the earlier films, we see that the technology used onboard is in the same vein of the retro 70s future aesthetic shown previously, complete with CRT analogue computer monitors and LCD number displays. Because of this, it's easy to become immersed in the eerie atmosphere of the once thriving space station, especially when there are no safe methods for anyone to escape. Álvarez conveys the feeling of danger early on as Rain's team explores the inner workings of the Renaissance, slowly but surely learning the fate of the space station's original crew. Each location always seemed like it could be hiding a sinister secret, whether related to why the Renaissance was even there to begin with or how the Xenomorph eggs found their way on board in the first place.However, one area where this film falters the most is in its exposition-heavy first act. Without giving away spoilers, the film spends way too much time setting up certain characters' backstories when in the end it felt kind of redundant considering what happens to them at the conclusion. Most of the information here could have been provided to us through a five minute conversation as opposed to padded out dialogue that takes up almost the entirety of the film's introduction. Although I understand the need to establish the crew's motivations for wanting to plunder in a deserted space station, there wasn't any real need to have it drag on longer than it did. Despite that, the film's superb second and third acts thankfully make up for this unfortunate shortcoming.Although she doesn't quite come close to the level of Sigourney Weaver, I did enjoy Cailee Spaeny's performance as Rain, whose role in the film is equally as admirable. At first, Rain seems reluctant and even terrified to take on this job of joining a team to raid an abandoned space station, but over the course of the story she really comes into her own. Rain can be viewed as something of a maternal figure for the group, especially in regards to her relationship with the Synthetic Android Andy (David Jonsson). It was interesting to watch how Rain treats Andy almost like he were her son or even her younger brother, despite him not actually being a real human capable of feeling emotions. There were also a few surprisingly believable scenes of her trying to defend the whole crew from the Xenomorph threat, which is, as anyone familiar with the franchise should know, a task easier said than done.For anyone who has been left underwhelmed by the franchise's recent offerings, ""Alien: Romulus"" will no doubt win back anyone hoping to see the series return to form. It recaptures as much of its horror origins as possible while also adding in some nice new touches to help remind us of why the series has remained so relevant after all these decades. Best of all, being a standalone movie, you don't even need to have seen any other film in the franchise to understand what is happening, although it is better if you have as there are a handful of Easter eggs and hidden references for the long term fans to point out. Though it is currently unclear which direction things will go from here, I nonetheless anticipate the next entry with a decidedly optimistic outlook.I rate it 8/10.",2024-08-15
305,drunk_please_disregard,Well made but somehow not,6,"Has anyone else noticed the soul being sucked out of movies generally and remakes/prequels/re-imaginings/sequels/side stories of great franchises specifically? This one is not immune unfortunately. The production values and performances in this film are great, however it somehow is less impactful and enjoyable compared to the original movies. The aliens look awesome and the callbacks are appreciable, but somehow I found myself rolling my eyes throughout significant portions. In the end it ultimately just feels like another lame attempt to cash in on a legitimately scary and original concept from 35+ years ago. Yet again. The moral of the story is that filmmakers/capitalists need to stop trying to exploit these ip's because it detracts from and embarrasses the source material. ""Die motherf....."" indeed.",2024-12-05
306,chris_green1981,A good all rounder,7,"Like many I LOVE Alien. Outside of the film's I read the books, comics and immersed myself in Alien lore. And like others have said, it's a greatest hits kinda movie.It's better than 3, Resurrection, and most certainly Covenant! I like liked Promethius, and feel this is on parr, but way more of an actual Alien film with far better characters overall. Let's not even bother with a certain 2 other films (AVP).It has it all, and the first 2 acts were great, good suspense and set pieces. Some very good gore and practical effects. The sets, design, everything felt true to the lore and universe. There is a 'cameo' which I personally hated, but no spoilers. And the use of gravity in space was really well done, not seen before in Alien like this I feel (more like Dead Space!). I really enjoyed it.So what about act 3. It didn't ruin the film really, it just didn't need to exist. Whether it was a writer/director choice, it seemed more studio mandated in my opinion. I hate quibbling about plot holes and tie ins, but some of the biological lore of the xenomorph was played fast and loose. Which nighled me, and I imagine would annoy purists.Would I see it again, hell yes. The fist 2 thirds really delivered. No idea where they could go from here though, because so much ground is trodden over from the previous films. However after the sour taste of Covenant (the worst in my opinion, excluding you know who!), this was a welcome end. Just not sure what anyone could do from here? Unless you went full Earth War like in the books/comics of the 90s. And then, is it even Alien anymore?",2024-08-18

The blend of stunning visuals and a gripping storyline captivates from start to finish. The cast delivers stellar performances, making the fear and desperation palpable.

They probably want to get their heads checked, but goodness, bravo.The plot was predictable but that didn't diminish its impressiveness one sausage. The only thing that detracted from it a little was that it was hard to make out the dialogue, especially in the beginning. For some reason it just didn't carry well in the cinema and sounded muddy. The British accents were particularly hard to understand and I'm British myself.The perfect horror film showcasing things of nightmares, but without leaving any lasting images that are going to haunt me when I turn the bedroom light out later.

Of course, the main character is still far from Sigourney Weaver and Noomi Rapace, but her performance did not cause any negative. And the crown of the best actor in this movie would go to the assault rifle with a smart stock, who really had to sweat. Someone will say that this is a kind of fanfic movie based on previous films, but I will say that this is a solid sci-fi horror-slasher that probably takes a well-deserved fourth place in my list of the Alien series and a worthy continuation of the line of this anthology.",2024-08-16

And it's back with a solid entry - but don't take that from me, I already (really) liked Prometheus and got enough of a kick out of Covenant.This one feels like a mesh between the first two movies of the series, with so many reverences that it gives off a sense of trying a bit too hard. Starring a gen Z (ish) cast for the first time and set between Alien and Aliens, it's not a very ambitious movie in terms of furthering the lore, but what it does, it does very well - most of the time.The highlights are the amazing scenes in space and the synthetic person, here powered by Rye Lane's David Jonsson. With some awesome set-pieces along the way, as well as some highly unlikely moments very much in the vein of the more recent Alien movies, Romulus has a solid pulse - until the last act.It fails to really up the ante for the last twenty or so minutes, content to not only be inspired, but rather copy elements from the previous films, all executed in a workmanlike fashion. It's a shame, because a hair-raising finale elevated Prometheus for me, but here the conclusion is a let-down - in spite of said amazing space vistas.All in all though, a satisfying addition to the face hugger empire from Fede Alvarez, whetting my appetite for the upcoming TV series, Alien: Earth.",2024-08-14

That fact appears to be lost on those lauding poor acting, a terrible script, and direction.The participants have diminished the legacy of the original by being unable to capture the intense drama and horror of the unknown that unfolds in it. They attempt to compensate by packing scenes, and on occasion, dialogue, from superior efforts, of other movies.With no real character development, none have any personality, and waltz through each scene like a fun-house. Even the Aliens can't instill a feeling of dread, and if the writers and director managed that, their victims are automatons.This is Alien Lite for an unsophisticated audience that never saw the first two or three in the series, and likely can't perceive why the first two set a precedent that may never be equalled. With a glut of low quality movies in recent years, perhaps individuals are starved for anything that appears contemporary to their demographic that isn't part of the MCU.

316,pcanavan1989,A good solid addition to the franchise.,8,"Finally got to see this today and I had been looking forward to it for a long time. I am a long time fan of the films and loved them all apart from ""Resurrection"" and ""Covenant"". Initially I was skeptical upon hearing it was in production, but after the marketing it got me hyped.The opening of the film was fantastic and it set the tone perfectly. While the characters are mostly forgettable apart from Rain and Andy, the film does do well in terms of character development.The practical effects are fantastic and so happy they didn't go down the route of ""Covenant"" and rely too much on CGI for the creatures. Not going to spoil anything but there was a couple of scenes that relied on CGI to portray a certain character and it looked a bit silly. Still, it doesn't take away too much from the spectacle.The score is top tier and is great at capturing the feel of the franchise with clever nods to previous entries.Story-wise, it's premise is nice and simple and executes what it intends to do pretty well. You will have some unanswered questions when you finish watching but I like the fact they left some parts up to our imaginations, and I am sure they will explain things in future films/series.I am not going to say much about the ending. It's different yes and probably could have had a slightly better idea but you can decide that for yourselves. Some will like it, and inevitably some will hate it.Overall, a very good summer horror flick for audiences both old and new and just go into it with an open mind and enjoy.",2024-08-17
317,steveinadelaide,Atmospheric and chilling,7,"Yes! We have another addition to the Alien series of movies that started back in 1979. This is the fifth installment (unless you count Prometheus, which is contentious). It was initially going to release on the streaming service Hulu. But fortunately, it was changed to a cinema release.In Alien: Romulus, a crew of explorers uncovers a dark secret onboard a derelict space station. Of course, if you've watched previous Alien movies, you'll know what that secret is and the way in which the crew will have to fight for their lives while trying to orient themselves to the station that they have never visited before. It's also worth noting that this episode is set between the original Alien movie and Aliens, the second movie.Romulus has the same atmospheric and claustrophobic setting as other Alien movies. And there is lots of intense suspense, with the occasional jump scare that will have you levitating from your seat. The creatures are both visually stunning and scary. And there are strong performances from the cast. Cailee Spaeny is very good as Rain, and David Jonsson is brilliant as Andy, Rain's personal android robot. His subtle facial and body movements are convincing in persuading us that he is almost human, but not quite. And the special effects, which are often practical rather than CGI (although there is a bit of CGI here and there), are very effective.There are a few issues: Some of the plot elements are predicable, and the director has relied heavily on familiar horror tropes. During the middle act, there are some pacing issues, and the character development of the characters could have been deeper.Having said that, Romulus is a thrilling ride, particularly if you are a fan of the Alien franchise or if you are just a horror fan. While the movie doesn't break new ground, it does deliver on its promise of some intense scares and a chilling atmosphere. And there is plenty of graphic violence and disturbing imagery in this one, so I'd definitely recommend it only for mature audiences.",2024-08-16
318,mdw0526,"A great and scary entry in the ""Alien"" canon...",8,"We saw this new film in IMAX the other day and it was more than worth a trip to the cinema on opening weekend. If you're a fan of the original '79 and '86 classics, then this one's for you as it takes place between ""Alien"" and ""Aliens"" and feels quite similar in structure and spirit. It was taut and scary and had a bunch of call-backs to previous movies that some have derided as unnecessary fanservice but which I enjoyed. The third-act is terrifying and gross and pretty great, and a familiar face from a previous film was used to decent effect even though some had their knickers in a twist about it. The young cast is very attractive and you get to know them just enough to be sad when they depart (as nubile neophytes always do in movies like this). Of course, no one can hold a candle to Sigourney Weaver's Ellen Ripley, but Cailee Spaeny is great and I think this sets the franchise on a good path forward for a new generation. Definitely go see this one!",2024-08-21
319,ruffinopaolo,Good movie to watch but nothing new,7,"The movie delivers a solid entry into the iconic franchise, offering a mix of suspense, horror, and nostalgia that fans will appreciate. Directed by Fede Alvarez, the movie is set between the events of Alien (1979) and Aliens (1986), and it successfully captures the claustrophobic tension and visceral horror that defined those early films.The story revolves around a group of young space colonists who stumble upon a derelict space station, leading to a terrifying encounter with the deadly xenomorphs. Alvarez does a commendable job of building suspense, especially with the use of practical effects that harken back to the franchise's roots. The facehuggers, in particular, are more terrifying than ever, and the film's setting adds to the sense of dread with its dark, labyrinthine corridors.However, while Alien: Romulus excels in creating atmosphere and delivering thrills, it doesn't offer much in terms of new ideas or innovation. The plot leans heavily on familiar tropes and fan service, which, while enjoyable, can make the film feel a bit predictable and reliant on nostalgia. Additionally, some aspects of the story, such as the introduction of certain new characters and concepts, might come off as unnecessary or distracting.Overall, if you're a fan of the Alien series, you'll likely find Alien: Romulus a worthwhile watch. It delivers on the core elements that make the franchise great, even if it doesn't break new ground.",2024-08-17
320,aronharde,More of the same but really well executed,8,"I absolutely love the Alien franchise with every movie connected to it (yes every single one of them). Obviously there are stronger and definitely weaker entries but I am so fascinated by the world that Ridley Scott created in 1979 that I appreciate every single bit of new context. Therefore I was really anticipating this new entry into the original franchise. The fact that Fede Alvarez was directing was also comforting since I really enjoyed Don't Breathe and his Evil Dead remake.The movie provides lots of fan-service and I heard people complain about that which is confusing since the movie does not only offer fan-service, but also an amazingly thrilling story with awesome sequences and lots of suspense. If the movie would only consist of fan-service, I would totally get the criticism but this movie has so much more to offer to the audience. Even though the movie doesn't really add anything new to the franchise, the things that it does are executed really well. They weren't taking risks with experimental things which could have also worked really well but whatever. The gritty sets and terrifying looking Xenomorphs and Facehuggers give this movie a dark and horrifying look, making it one of the scariest entries in the franchise. Obviously the movie is not perfect and there are minor flaws that can be overlooked. I personally didn't find the characters to be that interesting and even rather forgettable. None of them were even close to our favorite action heroine from the original franchise. But that is not to be expected and the cast does a great job portraying their characters. Also there is a deep-fake of a face that looks a little unsettling for some time. However if you are a fan of the franchise or not, this movie will definitely deliver some scary action sequences that will stay in your head for some time and therefore I think it's definitely a successful addition to the franchise with a little surprise at the end.

My probelm however is with the ending and I hate it.

That's not to say my expectations were low for Alien: Romulus, but I never imagined it to be as cinematically polished as it was. Cailee Spaeny as the lead was a certified scene stealer, the writing was smart and impactful, and the use of lighting and special effects to craft a tense atmosphere was, for all intents and purposes, flawless. Another feat worth mentioning was Director Fede Alvarez's ability to raise the stakes organically without bogging down the momentum with exposition. Whether you're a fan of the franchise or not, I would set aside a few hours this week to catch the new Alien film while it's still in IMAX.",2024-08-29
323,paul_haakonsen,Quite good...,7,"From the first time seeing the trailer for this movie, then it was without a doubt a movie that I would have to watch. And I will say that my expectations were indeed rather high for the movie.And now having just watched it, was it all that the trailer made it out to be? Well, yes and no. Yes, the movie was definitely as intense as the trailer it out to be, but I have to say that the last part of the movie was a tad over the top for me. And personally I would have enjoyed the movie way more if they had stopped with the xenomorphs and not brought that mutation into the equation.The storyline was good, and it felt like a mixture of the 1979 ""Alien"" and 1986 ""Aliens"" movies, and that was definitely a good thing, because they are without a doubt the best movies in the franchise. So writers Fede Alvarez and Rodo Sayagues definitely managed to put together an enjoyable script. It is a story that starts out nicely, and slowly builds up the layers, the intensity and the thrills.Of the entire cast ensemble, then I was only familiar with Ian Holm. But they definitely had a good cast ensemble for the various roles, and the acting performances were good.Visually then ""Alien: Romulus"" was phenomenal. They captured the essence of the 1979 first ""Alien"" movie in visuals, and they really paid a lot of attention to detail. And there was quite a lot to take in with each scene. The production of the scenes and sets were quite astounding.The practical effects, special effects and visual effects in the movie are great. I definitely enjoy movies where they still use practical effects and don't just resort to CGI effects to do the job. There is just a whole different aestethic to the movie with practical effects. And when practical effects are done right, as they were in ""Alien: Romulus"", it just plays out so well. And it is a joy to watch all those facehuggers in the movie.It wasn't just all fine and dandy, though, as there were some parts that felt unnecessary and were fan-catering. Some of the dialogue, where they references ""Aliens"", just felt a bit forced and awkward. And if they had opted for an all original dialogue, it would have had a better flow to it.""Alien: Romulus"" is indeed a very enjoyable and watchable movie, and a great return to the ""Alien"" franchise in the spirit of the 1979 ""Alien"" and 1986 ""Aliens"" movies.My rating of director Fede Alvarez's 2024 movie ""Alien: Romulus"" lands on a seven out of ten stars.",2024-08-16

I liked the movies up until Covenant. It grew so beautifully through time.Romulus had no life. I might not be the intended target audience, but if you say ""alien"" in the header one will have certain expectations. Romulus met none of mine. It even looked cheap, taking into account how technology has developed in the last 7 years. Romulus is a teenage drama with unbearable characters with nothing in their heads. I feel bad for teenagers for being represented as such hollow heads.Please revert back to 1986-2017. Looking forward to the next one, it could not possibly be worse than this.",2024-10-19

After a key moment the movie speeds up and it will have you sit on nails until the very end.Fede Alvarez captures the cluastrophobia from the first movie, the dirt, the grit and the sci-fi horror elements from the first 3 movies and so much more.If you love the franchise this movie will satisfy your thirst and more.

That's where this film feels a little undercooked.You are really running off the fumes of the great set design, the seamless ratio of practical to computer generated effects, giving quite an innovative and promising level of immersion other filmmakers should really strive to achieve.So despite its weaknesses, it still has a pretty strong atmosphere and sense of place. It really ramps things up in the final portion, proving that with a few script touches here and there could have truly measured up much closer to its original predecessors.",2024-10-18
327,ZeddaZogenau,Back to LV 426: ALIENs For A New Generation,8,"It all began on the moon LV 426 in the year 2122, when the crew of the Nostromo, with a certain Ellen Ripley (multiple ACADEMY AWARD nominee Sigourney WEAVER) on board, brought a Xenomorph into the spaceship. Twenty years later, the moon without sunlight is populated by miners who have to toil for the Weyland-Yutani company with no prospect of ever seeing sunlight. How do young people grow up in such a hopeless environment? How are they shaped by such catastrophic circumstances? The original director Fede ALVAREZ from Uruguay explores this question in his film ALIEN: ROMULUS, which is set between the two classics ALIEN (1979) and ALIENS (1986). Ellen Ripley will spend another 37 years in cryogenic sleep flying through space when a group of young people (David JONSSON, Isabela MERCED, Archie RENAUX and Cailee SPAENY, who won the Coppa Volpi in Venice in 2023 for her role as Priscilla BEAULIEU PRESLEY) set out to hijack an abandoned spaceship. But we remember: At the end of ALIEN, Ellen Ripley managed to throw an unwelcome passenger overboard...Fede ALVAREZ (born 1978) from Montevideo goes back to the horror film roots of the ALIEN series and at the same time brings young people (suitable for the blockbuster target group) into play as space characters who cannot yet fully see through the dark machinations of the space-spanning corporation Weyland-Yutani. What is delivered is an acid-soaked body horror spectacle that clearly breathes new life into the Alien series. Of course, it can't be as exciting and full of never-before-seen images as in 1979 or 1986, but this film is still extremely worthwhile!",2024-08-15
328,mason25,Good but nothing new,6,"For what it was it was well done and done with a massive budget, yet failed to really deliver anything of substance. A lot of money was spent on sets, or CGI, which make this a beautiful looking movie, but it doesn't deliver on the character aspect at all. A cast of what feels like unknown up and comers that just happened to show up that day for casting. Andy was the only one that felt like a real person which is a bit amusing.The larger issues were the inconsistencies between the known lore we've watched and learned from over the last 30 years and what was presented here.The gestation period has always been at least a few hours, if not more. Asian girl gets one implanted and in less than 20 minutes she's bursting.Followed immediately by the chest burster growing to full size in under 10 minutes.This ridiculous error is doubled down on when the human xeno hybrid grows. Whilst it was nice to watch it grow, it makes no sense from a medical stand point. Something growing needs fuel of some sort to do just that... it hadn't eaten anything and went from egg to 9 foot tall on a diet of air. Yeah...sure it did.About the only thing that was an improvement was that they didn't call the acidic blood ""molecular acid"".The endless call backs to prior installments in the franchise were all way to blatantly obvious and in your face, which isn't the way to do them. Leave a small nod to a previous movie in the background for the eagle eyed to catch it, not make a whole scene about it, or force some cringe worthy dialog on Andy.Overall I enjoyed it, but won't likely watch it with the regularity that all of the others are done with.

Terribly boring story with characters you do not care about in the slightest and the most cringe inspiring throw backs to the previous alien films possible. Nothing original and not in the slightest scary. I wanted the aliens to kill the entire cast as quickly as possible so I could get home and forget about the money I just paid to watch this nonsense.

Iv loved these films all my life and some of the scenes were legitimately a visual spectical. But other than that it seemed very rushed and I feel a bit gore, alien guts deprived.. I wish there was a bit more action and less running.. many times this movie feels like it's on the pulse of creating something new, but by the end it was almost a carbon copy with high grade effects. And for that reason I'll be revisiting the old movies to get the time I think the fans deserve back in the alien world.. also I'm not sure if anyone remembers but after the first alien peeked its head out, I genuinely laughed. Also I feel like they traveled through two or 3 tunnels max, if anyone played the Dead space game I think they could have actually learned a lot from that!!

332,johnhf-30910,"""There's Something In The Water""",8,"For the past couple of years the Alien franchise has been a rollercoaster ride of sequels, disjointed prequels and disastrous crossovers. I do give credit to Aliens as one of the best sequels ever made. The assembly cut of Alien 3 was a good improvement over the theatrical cut, but still a flawed story that shouldn't been made. Prometheus starts off promising that ends up in a right mess trying to connect to Alien, where in my opinion should have been left as a standalone story.Now we have this new instalment that acts as a interquel between Alien and Aliens. It's directed, written and produced by Fede Alvarez. He is known for some decent horrors like the remake of Evil Dead and Don't Breathe. I've been so hyped up to see how he would deliver to this franchise and he didn't disappoint for sure. The film is so in sync with Alien like a direct sequel you could call it. It's visually beautiful that honours Ridley Scott's work back in the 1970s/80s. The opening music made me have goosebumps with excitement knowing very well what I'm going into. Let's not forget the title card was nicely done too.The film itself just keeps you on the edge of seat with its claustrophobic themes that surely plays on your anxiety in some way of form. The face huggers and Xenomorphs look more frightening this time around with its dark and tense atmosphere as they lurk in the shadows. What really adds to this is that gone back to practical effects to add to the horror.The characters are well developed with some nice chemistry to the mix. The lead performance from Cailee Spaeny (Civil War) really carries the film with David Jonsson as their chemistry bounces back and forth. You can really root for her character with the sense of hope she brings and the inspiration of Ripley's character, played by Sigourney Weaver in the past films.There are some nice nods to Prometheus and Alien: Covenant by connecting some dots. It was great to see a cameo of character from the franchise that I'm not gonna mention because it's a big spoiler. Though this character does strengthen the connection to Alien. I did find the call backs to the previous films a bit too familiar for my liking. Some fans see it as nostalgic but the way I see it is lazy writing. Think of something original next time.Like the previous work of Fede Alvarez where he relies heavily on the shock factor where sometimes work and it doesn't in this instalment. Though like James Cameron, David Fincher and Jean-Pierre Jeunet did they own take on each film I do give credit to him.",2024-08-16

I remember that, when I saw the first of the francise, I could't get in my bedroom without turning the light on (let's not even mention the book, even scarier).

334,smperrett,Alien: Dead Space,9,"I was a little nervous going into the cinema as I had been so excited to see this movie ever since it was announced. I love Alien. I love Aliens. I love Don't Breathe. I love Prometheus. This is going to be Don't Breath with Xenomorphs? Is it going to ignore Prometheus? Will it work?I'm happy to say that Fede Alvarez has done it.From the first few frames I knew that Alien was in safe hands with this director. He understands what Alien fans want from a movie in 2024. The cinematography and audio made me feel like I was watching an 80's alien movie with modern day production values and technology. The practical effects were incredible and definitely helped with the realism of the facehuggers and xenos, creating a sense of terror that we haven't felt watching these movies for decades. There was tension present during many scenes which I feel would have been made redundant had the creators chosen to use CGI more heavily.The movies story was simple but extremely effective (as is the case with most great horror) thanks to some fantastic casting and acting. The characters are just normal people, but they actually make some smart decisions and think quickly to problem solve, which solved a huge gripe people had with Prometheus and Covenant. It was incredible to see the love that the director has for the franchise with lots of callbacks to every installment whilst doing something new and bringing the series back to it's horror roots. Some of the horror/action set pieces in Romulus are absolutely riveting.The only issues I had whilst watching Romulus was some of the CGI for a certain character took me out of the moment quite a bit. I appreciate what it tried to do but the CGI was just quite poor in this area. I also cringed a bit at one of the lines from Aliens being redelivered in a much less effective way. I loved EVERYTHING else about it.My final thoughts are that Fede Alvarez needs to be given the keys to make a Dead Space movie; NOW!Failing that, I will settle for having Alien: Romulus as a solid third best Alien film and a worthy addition to my annual Alien/Aliens binge watch!",2024-08-17
335,MerrimanLyon,It's an Alien movie... you know what that means...,7,"I went and saw this at the cinema last night, you should be aware that there are a LOT of very dark scenes in the movie, I struggled on a couple of occasions to see what was actually going on - not that this should surprise you, this is an Alien franchise movie after all. I imagine that once it hits home release and you watch it on a 55""+ screen you'll also be tilting your head trying to work out what's going on.As to the story, without giving anything away (if I can) there's not a lot original in here, but the use of practical SFX is really very well done, particularly one, erm, ""object"" that had the whole audience in the cinema gasp when the ""object"" appeared out of the shadow after being plonked on a desk in the first half of the movie. You'll know what I mean when you see ""it"".So, exceptional SFX IMHO, but as others have said, nothing hugely original, the final act takes definite cues from Alien Resurrection (some might say controversially, but I think it was better done here), as well as Zack Snyder's Dawn of the Dead, and also from the original Alien movie, but let's be honest with ourselves - after you've seen the original Alien you pretty much know what's going to happen in any Alien movie after that, so the scares aren't quite so visceral, and the writer has to keep finding ways to try and turn the volume back up to 11. All that being said, it's very watchable, although on a side note I'm somewhat disappointed that all the theaters around me are sold out of the various popcorn buckets... I really fancied a Xenomorph head and a Facehugger (why the Hell didn't anyone come up with an Ovomorph bucket???) and there's no way I'm paying scalper prices on eBay for them. The cinema I went to told me that someone had come in and bough everything on the preview day - sad.",2024-08-18

337,csbob447,Surprisingly solid and fun!,7,"While I am a big fan of Alien and Aliens, the rest of the films in this franchise has not really excited me all that much. So with the announcement of a new Alien film that was kind of a spin-off and kind of a sequel to the first Alien movie, I wasn't eager to go check it out. Yet the fairly positive reception towards this movie, especially from friends that I trust on Letterboxd, my curiosity actually peaked. And I'll be honest, I was pleasantly surprised by this movie! Granted I do take issues with the movie, but as a whole I honestly had a lot of fun with the film in spite of my beef with certain aspects of the film. For one, it is a well directed movie. This time the keys are handed to horror director Fede Alvarez, who I have experienced before with the first Don't Breathe movie, which is a movie I would honestly call pretty overrated, so I wasn't super excited to see him attached to an Alien movie. But credit where it is due, he did direct his ass off with this movie! There are plenty of really tense scenes that actually had me at the edge of my seat, including a really tense hallway scene and another hallway scene that was actually pretty creative, along with Alvarez having a good scenic eye with the film, with plenty of great shots that are well framed and looks stunning. While it is clear how much of Ridley Scott's impeccable visual proficiency is an influence on this film's overall look, it doesn't feel as indebted to his style and feels like it is doing its own thing aesthetically and stylistically. Which, granted, it is a little hard to do with how important the first Alien movie is to this film, but it does feel distinctly its own thing in spite of its clear influence. Also, the score by Benjamin Wallfisch goes absolutely hard and works wonderfully with the scene in the film!The one real weak point is that the whole story surrounding the film feels pretty thin. Granted the stories in the Alien series can feel thin, either with the plots or the characters (well mainly the characters), yet this is the only film in the series that honestly feels like it has a disposable story. And it is disposable because I'm not quite sure if it is doing anything new with the Alien universe. It feels like the most straightforward movie in the series since the first Alien movie with its essential plot being a survival horror story, and while that isn't exactly a bad thing, it also does show how thin the whole story feels, as it doesn't exactly add anything new that the other films already added. The plot itself isn't bad, it's fine for what it is, yet it feels like it is just recycling ideas before. I guess the only thing relatively new to this is the relationship between humans and androids, which is really the only thing that feels fresh with the universe, even if the thematics feels rather basic. Much of the criticism of capitalism and the abuse of the working class doesn't really present any new ideas that were presented before in any of the other films in the series, and honestly it can feel too on-the-nose with its criticism that can feel pretty annoying. The characters are honestly some of the more likable characters in the Alien series outside of the first two movies, but even still they also feel pretty thin and not super interesting. The one exception, however, is Andy, who is the android in the film and honestly does have the most interesting character arc in the film. Well, really, the only character that has an arc in the film. Also David Jonsson's performance as Andy is really great. Both his performance in this and in Rye Lane does show how much promise he has as an actor and will, hopefully, go to a lot of great places in the future as an actor! The performances from the rest of the cast are pretty good too, with Cailee Spaeny makes for a good lead, and thankfully the movie doesn't go out of its way to make her Ripley 2.0 in her characterization. As for the fan service moments and callbacks to the prior Alien films... honestly they don't bug me all that much as other people might have, although the one exception is when they reference that line, which honestly had me rolling my eyes. And as for the appearance of you-know-who... well the effects used for its as uncanny, and honestly I hope that the actor agreed to this, because if not that feels extremely icky.Overall, Alien: Romulus surprised me with how much I had fun with it. I do think there are a lot of problems with the movie, but for what it is as a straightforward sci-fi horror film within the Alien universe, it honestly worked a lot better as that than crumbling under its own ambitions like Prometheus and Alien: Covenant, so there is that. I would say that this is the best Alien movie since Aliens way back when, but I can also see why people don't like this movie. For me personally, it was a fun time, but certainly nowhere as good as Alien or Aliens.

Most films nowadays don't execute the third act well and the movie usually comes crumbling down. Well, this one didn't disappoint and is the best Alien movie since Aliens. Although it is an easy to follow plot that pays homage to its predecessors, I actually didn't expect as many twists and new things introduced that haven't been done in the franchise yet. THIS is what I expected from Prometheus and Alien: Covenant. I was slightly worried once the film started rolling that the pacing might be too slow and all the action happens towards the end like the prequels. Luckily, the pacing was great and Fede brought out the best in the young cast. We now have a worthy prequel/sequel that fits nicely in between the first two movies in the same fashion as Rogue One with Star Wars. Caile Spaeny was great as the lead and I'm glad how they handled her character. The movie left me wanting more and I definitely want to see this again. Since I have the Alien Anthology in Blu-Ray, I now want a copy of Romulus. I'm curious on where they take the franchise next.",2024-08-16
339,jomoxshift,A fast-paced film from start to finish,6,"Come on, the film has a first problem which is its age range, even though it is something common in the world, especially in recent years. For me, this shorter age range was sorely missed.The film is very safe, there is nothing new, with the exception of the last arc, still there was no space for the main enemy of the franchise, so much happened, that I missed more Alien.The added sense of urgency in the second act was terrible, it took away the protagonism of what really should have been in this arc, with the mother reminding us of this all the time.I won't even comment on the moment when everyone changes, especially the antagonists, to somehow help the protagonist in trouble.Well, finally, let's go to the last act, the conclusion, with few characters to interact with, I felt less of an impact. However, without all that urgency in the script, I did manage to get all the tension I should have felt throughout the film.Conclusion is that even though I saw several problems, and felt the pace was too fast, at a certain level I managed to enjoy myself, it is not a film that I see the need to see in the cinema, but it's also not a complete waste of time and money 6/10.",2024-08-16
340,erickelso-24147,A phenomenal installment we've been waiting for since Aliens,9,"Prefect blend of everything. Immurses you into the pure and expansive world of Alien & Aliens while tenderly acknowledging the contributions of Prometheus. I was worried after Disney acquired the franchise, but it seems they did not meddle in the production. You can tell Fede is a true fan of the spirit of Alien and delivers an honorable and nostalgic installment into the saga. Easily the best film in the series behind Alien & Aliens. After decades of confusing and disappointing decisions by the studio, this is the first time a sequel doesn't feel misplaced. Excellent course-correction. With the exception of minor CG noticeabilities, this film remains as committed to the practical experience that made the original two films so iconics.",2024-08-16

The special effects, sounds, environment were almost exactly what was in the video game Alien Isolation which is a great thing.It really felt like there might be hope, and you maybe could get away each and every time, but how to lead us there is what makes the tempo of this film work well. It really won't be one of those moments where you will think ""wow, it's so new"" but it is so good at what it is.A horror film in space. A fear factor film about AI. The little guy (gal) against the corporate machine. Check marks galore and wow what a fun ride this one was. If you're new to the Alien franchise, you can go back and watch the original Alien and then Aliens to really get a feel of this one. I would love to see a really good PCVR ray traced version of this as a game with some variations on a theme (DLC etc) like Alien Isolation. The film uses a feeling of real time narrative in the second half which would really lend itself to a VR gaming treatment.This is without a doubt a great addition to a sci fi series that keeps me coming back for more.",2024-08-17

It's like Alvarez take everything he likes and put own twist. Maybe too much sometimes.But even when he does that, he does in a great way.It should be seen on the largest screen possible and with very loud sound. It has beautiful postcards and the sound work is remarkable.I need to watch this again.",2024-08-16

Overall I think the movies action sequences could've been better. I don't know if I would call this a good entry point for new fans though. Definitely left me wanting more. If you are a fan of this franchise, and the video games I think this movie is perfect for you. I'll definitely be adding this to my 4k collection when it comes out.

345,vitalymakievsky,"Good...but, it's basically a direct remake.",6,"I think for the audience, who have never seen the original Aliens movies, you will really enjoy the sci-fi horror genre blender. Not to mention the fantastic looking monster who were originally drawn by the legendary H. R. Giger.As far as the plot, I think the writer team, did a fantastic job of retelling the original Alien saga with a new touch, but in one film. The plot never felt forced but still little too fast paced for me.For some of you who are already huge fans of the original movies, I you will still enjoy this film. It retains a lot of the things that make the originals great. And I personally really liked the use of old computer technology which was considered high tech in the early 80s.The biggest problem with Alien: Romulus is that the lead isn't Sigourney Weaver, or anywhere close to the original character Ripley. The lead acted fine but, just not convincing to the role which she was given. There is zero edge to her, and she doesn't sell her role.",2024-08-16

Rain is badass, Ripley would be proud.This is a rare franchise that doesn't have a bad movie. There are several reasons why.The creature design is too good. Even when you have already seen it, you can't wait to see it again.The environment is scary as hell. Alot can go wrong in space, and space itself is scary and full of danger. Even when they settle on a planet or a ship, they take over quickly and it becomes their environment.The stakes are high because death isn't the worse thing that can happen. Getting caught by one of those things is far worse.Once the action starts its a non stop fight for survival.",2024-10-20
347,Scrimmy59,A solid installment held back by false claims,7,"Overall it was good. Animatronics were top notch!! CGI was overall good, minus the one character it's used on. Acting is good, characters for once aren't disturbingly stupid when it comes to their decision making. Soundtrack and atmosphere was solid, and it actually is a scary movie at times; which I wasn't expecting!But the brutality that was talked up by Alvarez and the rest of the cast; even reading multiple articles saying that those involved said ""the kills will be on screen and detailed and bloody"". Essentially hyping the movie up to be a bloodbath, was all a massive disappointment. The movie didn't live up to half of its hype in terms of brutality, especially the on screen kills.I know it's not all about that, but cmon; don't lie about it! Or just don't talk about it so people don't go in worh a preconceived notion on what they are about to witnessCertain moments had so much potential to create gore galore, and it let each moment go. In a way, the most disappointing movie of this year for me. Mainly because those involved in the project, basically straight up lied about the level of brutality in the film. I know there's others out there who see movies like this partially because we want to see how far the brutality is pushed; and this installment does a bad job at that.Hopefully there's a directors cut that just amps that way up.",2024-08-17

Loved that there were nods to Prometheus and Covenant. I don't believe the comments made about the CGI character hold water, and that was a vital plot element. Outstanding performances by the two main characters, but all of the characters are well developed and have heart. The tension is palpable and Time will show this to be an absolute classic. Very happy I saw it at the cinema as the sound was superb. Highly recommended!! Go see it! Go see it! Go see it! Go see it now ................,",2024-08-17

The bit I liked was the synthetic that was in the original alien film returned in this one but looked much younger I would have to watch the film again but I think romulas. Is a part of the ship that the young adults was on. But over all I enjoyed this film will definitely be watching it again for sure my score 7/10 make a sequel please.,2024-08-18

I was skeptical going into this, especially with an unfamiliar cast, but I was wrong. They outperformed my expectations. It was scary, suspenseful and visually stunning. This is must see in IMAX for sure. I found myself squirming in my seat on some scenes and nearly falling off the edge of it during others. Lol.

351,arsalanweb,Mutated Twist,7,"Alien: Romulus brings the familiar tension and horror of the classic Alien franchise, but with enough new elements to keep the audience on edge. The movie masterfully builds suspense, using claustrophobic settings and shadowy cinematography to evoke dread. The new cast gives strong performances, particularly the lead, who convincingly portrays both vulnerability and fierce determination.Where Romulus truly shines is in its final act, which delivers a fresh twist that shakes up the Alien formula. Unlike previous installments, where the xenomorphs are always the ultimate enemy, here we discover that the true danger comes from within the surviving crew itself. In a shocking reveal, it's shown that one of the crew members was intentionally infected with a modified alien strain and has been unknowingly incubating a deadly hybrid creature. This twist introduces a disturbing new layer of psychological horror, as the team unravels, not knowing who can be trusted anymore.While the middle of the movie feels a bit slow, the ending more than makes up for it, adding a unique and thrilling direction to the franchise. Overall, Alien: Romulus is a solid entry with enough surprises to satisfy both longtime fans and newcomers, though it doesn't quite reach the heights of the original.",2024-10-15

353,mitchell5954,A Decent Return to Form for the Franchise,7,"Alien Romulus is the latest alien movie, this time not directed by Ridley Scott, like the last couple, which might've been for the better. I didn't have high expectations going in, because the Alien franchise hasn't really been good since Aliens. The original Alien is a classic. Aliens is one of my favorite movies ever. Alien 3 is a film I have a love/hate relationship with. There's a lot of things about it I like, and many things I hate. Alein Resurrection sucks. As do Prometheus and Alien Covenant. The AVP films are bad, my I can say they're guilty pleasures for me, mainly the first one.Many people say Romulus is the best alien film since Aliens. In many aspects they're right, but in others maybe not. I certainly don't think it's as good as the first two films. Though, I would overall, put it over most, if not all, of the other movies.The best thing about this movie is the visuals. The cinematography is gorgeous, and the film has a consistent haunting atmosphere throughout. I love the look of the planet our characters are on at the start, and I wish we could've seen more of it. I would say Romulus, more than any other sequel, gets the closest to the feel of the original Alien, for better or worse. The xenomorphs haven't looked this good since Aliens. This is because they used mostly (if not entirely) practical effects. The score is also okay. Not the best, but not the worst either. There's a couple of real creative scenes we haven't really seen before.I also liked how this connects to other films in the saga. Romulus takes place between Alien and Aliens and addresses a question I've had regarding Aliens for the longest. Why would The Company do nothing for over fifty years regarding retrieving the aliens? This film deals with that criticism. I also like how this film acknowledges Prometheus and Alien Covenant. While I'm not a bug fan of those movies, I like that this film doesn't ignore them, and even slightly expands upon them in places. I was hoping they would at least mention David somewhere in the movies, to tell us what happened to him, but they don't.The characters are what bring this movie down some. Now, the characters are serviceable enough. They're not overly irritating or insanely dumb like many of the characters in Alien Resurrection, Covenant, or Prometheus. The one character that did irritate me died early on, so there's that. At the same time, the cast for this wasn't all that memorable to either compared to other installments. The one character that stood out a bit was the main android. Continuing the tradition of the androids being the most interesting characters in most of the alien films.The film doesn't do a lot new either. It does a couple things different, but largely it feels like its playing it safe with the alien formula. It's another space station as the primary setting, which we've seen before. Alien 3, Covenant, Prometheus, and even AVP gave us new environments to work off of. There's a lot of callbacks to the previous films. Some work, while others feel overly pandering and cringey.As an overall film, I would put Romulus over Alien Resurrection, Covenant, Prometheus, and the AVP movies. It's a decent film. Is it better than Alien 3? That's somewhat debatable, at least for me. I have to think about that. Romulus didn't diminish the ending of Aliens like Alien 3 did. But Alien 3 is a film that took more risks, and I got into the characters a bit more. It ultimately left more of an impact on me.",2024-08-22

It's an Alien movie and combines all the elements you would expect from this franchise and a few new twists. People have mentioned about taking certain parts of other movies
and re-using....quite correct, but this is a continuation of sorts from the original 79 movie and James Cameron's Aliens so your going to get similarities because it involves the same creature.Take no notice of the naysayers, grab a bag of popcorn and settle down to a good watch and a worthy addition to the Alien Universe.",2024-10-18

Unfortunately NOTHING happens for the first 40 mins and none of the people this 40 mins is about are very likable or interesting. Once it kicks into gear - it's GOOD. I'd the ending was a little lackluster - almost the exactly same feeling as covenant's ending...a little meh. The nostalgia factor is the best thing this movie has going. The links to the greater universe are BRILLIANT...Aside from AVPR, ALL the films are worth watching when it's time for a re-watch and thankfully this will be included (although like every movie I will make my own cut with a few trims). It's not fantastic, and because the beg was SO dull and uninvolving the movie feels long, until the end when you wish there was more and there's no time left lol. Overall it's uneveness is it's biggest downfall. Not the best Alien movie - I still say it goes Alien 3 (PC(, Aliens (DC), Alien (DC), Prometheus, Covenant, AVP & Resurrection) not the worst (AVPR). If anything PREY deserved a theatrical run and THIS should have gone to hulu. I love don't breathe 1 & 2 but other than that I'm not really sold on alverez. I really thought this movie was gonna lead into Aliens but they went with a throwback instead - which was cool don\t get me wrong - and I hope we get Prometheus 3 even if it's on hulu, THEN they can do a sequel to this.",2024-08-17

357,parkerrodney,A Real Cluster - A Movie I wish I could unsee,1,"Alien Romulus
Part I Failed Execution of a Worthy PlotIf the mission of the of movie was to provide clarity and context as to what occurred on LV-426 between the end of the first Alien movie and the beginning of the second, Aliens, then Alien Romulus (AR) fails miserably. During Aliens, it was revealed that a mining colony was setup on LV 426 and had been in operation for 20 years without incident or run in with the alien species. The storyline in Aliens is that shortly after discrediting Ripley's version of the facts, the Corporation loses communication with LV426. They then reinstate her to serve as a consultant in a rescue mission and to return to LV426. If AR was supposed to bridge the story gap of the preceding 20 years on LV426 and most specifically how the colony was infected and wiped out, well it certainly did not do that. Since film makers are more manipulative than stupid, we have to conclude that the failure to bridge the storyline was intentional and not the intention of the movie at all. What then was the purpose of the movie? The answer is that we don't know.Casting age, Immature, and childish.When actors are selected for roles, they are supposed to be age appropriate, and appearance appropriate, and have the physical characteristics to do what needs to appear convincing in a role. This is especially critical in action movies. In AR the protagonist as well as her many compatriots appear far to young to be credible. Their behaviors are of irresponsible teens and young adults that spend their time jury rigging and hacking rather than being scientists and military personnel.Bad Acting and Shallow Script
After failing to deliver on a movie that would bridge the storyline between Alien and Aliens, AR fails to deliver it's own cohesive storyline other than it is a movie about some young adults that want to flee LV426. They simply didn't have the maturity in appearance and in scriptwriting to make it believable The rest of the movie is a garbage salad of everything that we have seen before, a cliché of people running, screaming, hiding and dying in the same manor and flavor of the prior Alien movies. AR was about time and money I will never recover. A movie I wish that I could unsee, but the damage is already done.",2024-08-17
358,kraigwhite,Great first half. Disappointing second half.,6,"My headline speaks for itself but feel I need to elaborate the latter. It seemed like a tick list of nods and winks to previous movies and even a video game. The trailer made it feel like I would get another suspense filled survival in the same vein as the first Alien movie. Not really. I got the impression it has been tinkered with as the second half pacing etc seemed different to the first half. Did not like the ending. It seems to pay homage to another film and did not like it then, too. There was even one part nearer the end that seemed jarring between two shots. It made me think that either a part had been taken out or a massive change had been made via reshoots. I was expecting much more horror violence. I'd hoped for old school but got modern instead. Can't help but feel the film would of had a bigger and longer lasting impact had it been the former. I'm hoping for a directors cut to see if the original vision comes through better.",2024-08-25

The aesthetic is very much that of the original Alien movies (Alien & Aliens), with hints of other movies from the franchise (and some famous lines make a slightly cheesy return). This film feels more like a homage to the original two movies rather than something fresh, but I didn't mind because the director has created it in such a way that it is just pure entertainment. It was also nice to see a certain *weapon* make a return in all of its prototype glory. I think it's very much intended for the fans, but whether you are a fan or not, I think this movie has something for everyone.Solid 8/10 for me.",2024-08-17

Proving big budgets aren't necessary.Good sound and overall production valueThe thing that lets this movie down is the script. It starts off well, has a bit of a wobble in the middle, and goes kinda off the rails at the end. There's too many unnecessary throwbacks to other alien movies that just weren't necessary or were even kinda cringe and forced.It does have some good action sequences and cool ideas.I heard that the third act would split fans and I'm on the side of the people who it didn't work for.

But it's bogged down by cheesy fan service and too many repeat beats from the previous films.I get it. There are only so many stories to tell under the sun. At the end of the day, the best we can do is one-up our predecessors while paying them homage. Right?Balderdash.We can do better than this. And it seems like Fede, demonstrating such command of visuals, music, and atmosphere, has the skills. But the characters feel generic and unimportant, the stakes are low, and all the winks and nods to previous films ruin an immersive experience. Like so many other films of late, the viewer is too aware that this is a movie, this is IP, instead of being romanced and immersed by true drama, tension, and suspense. Romulus unfortunately falls into the bin of ""decent facsimile"" while offering nothing truly great or memorable.

I didn't keep my hopes up but it was a really really good movie. Not as sophisticated as the first movie. But cinematography was quite good. It is in a solid 4th place in the lore.

The movie is packed with callbacks, Easter eggs, and familiar faces that hit all the right nostalgic notes. Even though I went in with low expectations, I found myself grinning at all the little nods to the franchise's past. Sure, it leans heavily into what fans want, but sometimes, that's exactly what you're in the mood for-something that feels like a love letter to the universe you grew up with.The third act, though, is where the movie truly shines, feeling more like *Prometheus* than the original *Alien*. It ramps up the tension and delivers on the action in a way that had me on the edge of my seat. The pacing, the visuals, and the intensity all come together to create a climax that captures the haunting, sci-fi spectacle that *Prometheus* brought to the series. Even if the earlier parts of the movie felt a bit too reliant on nostalgia, the final act stands on its own, reminding us why this franchise has endured for so long. It's a satisfying conclusion that left me pleasantly surprised and genuinely entertained.",2024-08-29
365,josiahdrozek,Alien: Romulus - Derivative and Innovative,9,"Alien Romulus rides on the fine line between derivative and innovative. For an entry in such a long running series, it is inevitable there will be some sense of ""been there, done that"", but Romulus manages to avoid this trope by providing twists on the old, and surprise in the new.Following the trend of the earlier films and even elements of the newer entries like Prometheus and Covenant, the cinematography by Galo Olivares is evocative and awe-inspiring, giving a fantastic sense of scale and atmosphere into each scene. It hearkens back to the simplicity found in the original 1979 film, of which Romulus feels like a logical sequel to. Existing chronologically between the original film and 1986's Aliens, Romulus feels like a true bridge between the two, seamlessly integrating a relentlessly tense thriller experience with moments of high octane set pieces and action, making for a film that keeps you glued to the screen.The characters are nothing special -- but they did not need to be. What we got were characters who feel human -- ones who make smart decisions, rational choices, and avoid the eye rolling stupidity found in the cast of the previous two entries. A particular highlight is the two main characters, Rain and Andy -- their relationship is something new to the series and provides the heart of the film while creating many interesting moments of drama through their interaction with other members of the main cast. Without getting into spoilers, there was one character in the film whose CGI was slightly distracting, but was not a deal breaker.As a long time fan of the Alien franchise, I loved the film, it gave me what I wanted and what I did not expect, while reinvigorating my enthusiasm for the series -- which is all I was hoping for. Is it a perfect movie? No. Alien Romulus is however a fantastic thrill ride of a film and is worth the theater experience -- it is certainly one of my most memorable ones. I would rank Romulus right below Aliens as my favorite film in the franchise, with the original Alien right behind it. Chasing nostalgia is a losing game and while we all want more films like the ones we grew up watching, the truth is that we will never be satisfied. Alien and Aliens are great, and Romulus is too -- it might just require taking off those rose tinted glasses to see it.",2024-08-22

This movie brings back the intensity of the original with beautiful pacing and visuals and then it also brings back the action we got to see in Aliens.Don't get me wrong it's not on the level of Alien or Aliens at all those are masterpieces but this being the weakest link in a trilogy is a very good problem to have and I can't wait to watch them in order!If you haven't seen it just know the thing that will annoy you the most is the CGI mouth!",2024-08-18
368,isaacwest-66001,WE'RE SO BACK,7,"Romulus isn't as good as Alien and Aliens, (which is fine because those are both amazing), but it is the first Alien movie to actually come close at points; and it's not because of its many nostalgia call-backs, because it is actually really good (keep in mind, I am a huge sucker for sci-fi action thrillers and Aliens is my favorite movie so I admit 8/10 may be a bit of a reach built on hype but give me a break a good Alien movie has never been released in my lifetime before).The most notably accomplishment of this movie is it easily the most beautiful of the alien movies. As the newest one you can expect that, but a lot of the shots were truly breathtaking, not something you'd expect from a movie that has no plants in it.An important milestone for this movie is it is the first Alien movie to have memorable, original characters since Aliens (besides Michael Fassbender's David). Still, not as good as those characters but Cailee Spaeny and David Jonsson do a great job. The others were alright but that's a huge improvement from all of the other Alien movies.Now if you're like me and are more focused and fascinated by the alien than anything, you won't be disappointed. It is at it's most beautiful, with many of actions and kills having a strong mix of familiar and new.There are some issues I do take issue with. One non-spoiler one is that sometimes it feels a little too close to Alien, but it had enough of its own unique strengths that I don't consider it a major detriment. Some of the side-characters could have been better but they were still good.Some minor spoilers for my other two issues: the CGI for Rook is terrible, and I've never seen such bad CGI in a triple-A film. The other is they don't fill the a plot hole on how the crew got the ship and were allowed to leave. It's not major issue, and there's lots of easy explanations you could come up with, but it would have been nice to have like a 10-20 second explanation. These two issues are minor in the grand scheme though. It's just weird that in a movie with such amazing effects Rook looks so bad, maybe they should have his face ripped off and just have his skull talking.To reiterate, this a very entertaining and surprisingly gorgeous film that makes the Alien literally awesome and fearsome again. What holds it from being a 10 is it relies on nostalgia a bit too much and most of the characters aren't great, but still good. I highly recommend it. It's easy the best Alien film outside of the first two, not because all of the rest are hugely disappointing, but because it is actually quite exceptional.",2024-08-25
369,calummacleod-51310,A rip-roaring ride worthy of its spot in the franchise,9,"It's fairly accepted that when a new Alien film is on the horizon there is always going to be a certain level of excitement mixed with trepidation. After the sublime first two movies in the series, the franchise has hit quite a few bumps in the road with the unnecessarily complex Prometheus and the frankly ridiculous Alien Vs Predator.So when Alien: Romulus director, Fede Alvarez talked about going back to basics, the hope of a return to form, became much higher. And we were right to be excited because what Alvarez has brought to the screen is an Alien film more than worthy of its spot up there with the best of them.The simple plot of a group of young adults trying to escape their lives on a working colony, is all that is needed to set us up. They find a seemingly abandoned space station that, predictably has something lurking in the shadows that very soon becomes evident.Amazing use of lighting and sound as well as impressive cinematography really brings the tone and creates moments of genuine horror as the protagonists try and escape the Xenomorph's. Cailee Spaeny as Rain and David Johnson as Andy, lead a fresh cast that brings energy and engagement and, although, there is always going to be an inevitablity about the fate of most involved, we find ourselves caring about their fate.There are moments that could have been built upon and there could be more screen time for the horrifically scary Xenomorph's but there is a palpable energy throughout that creates tense-filled set pieces that will be talked about for years to come.This includes an epilogue that shows a transition in the monsters that is as frightening as it is unbelievable.There will be those that tries to compare this film to Alien or Aliens but, despite nods to both, it doesn't try to be either at any stage. As it is set in between the two, we are given a surprise in a return character that many will moan about, but actually helps to fit the story together perfectly.Alien: Romulus is a fantastic ride and will rightly be seen as one of the blockbuster successes of the summer. Without doubt the third best Alien film and finally a worthy successor to Aliens almost 40 years on.",2024-08-22
370,CinemaSerf,Alien : Romulus,7,"I gather director Fede Alvarez made a conscious - and probably expensive - decision to keep the use of CGI to a minimum here and it really does work. ""Rain"" (Cailee Spaeny) and her ""brother"" are looking to get off-planet but she can't get travel papers from the all-powerful mining company. Desperate, she and ""Andy"" (David Jonsson) are offered a chance by wide boys ""Tyler"" (Archie Renaux) and ""Bjorn"" (Spike Fearn) to raid a decrepit old spacecraft that appears to be in a decaying orbit, so they can pinch it's cryogenic pods and enable them all to escape to another planet out of reach of their enthralling taskmasters. Off they set onto the ""Romulus"" and that's where, well you just know what's going to happen now, as they inadvertently turn the central heating on and find themselves in mortal danger. ""Andy"" just happens to be a synthetic, which proves especially useful when they discover the remains of ""Rook"" (the spitting image of the late Sir Ian Holm) but is this oozing mess of gunge and wiring actually an help or an hindrance? Getting off is going to be a lot harder than getting on! To be honest, the acting here is really neither here nor there. Renaux and Isabella Merced - their cohort ""Kay"" do enough, Fearn rather over-plays his chip-on-the-shoulder character and there's a slightly soporific effort from Jonsson, but that's not what I was watching for. This is all about the best monsters sci-fi cinema has ever created, and right from their first appearance I was in their corner. There's loads of darkly shot menace crammed into the two hours with plenty of references to it's originator and even more insinuations about the greed of a ""company"" that doesn't know when to leave well alone. Just like the other ""Alien"" films, it takes a Russian Doll approach to the ending, so don't think we're going to get off with just the one, definitive, ""get away from her..."" moment, and of course the lift plays a pivotal part in the proceedings as acid blood drips everywhere. It's not so good as the first two Sigourney Weaver outings, but slips neatly into bronze medal position for me in a series that can still prove quite compellingly scary. It's a cinema must - telly just won't do the lighting and photography justice at all.",2024-08-20
371,missreneb,LOVED IT - The 3rd BEST,8,"This Alien effort is so worthy of viewing if you are into the Alien Series. Alien, Aliens and Romulus are the top films in this franchise. Prometheus started off excellent and Alien Covenant was okay however Romulus seems a better fit in the franchise IMO.It is frightening and twitchingly scary. The characters are well developed, the effects are outstanding, loved the story line and direction. And when you think about the last 20 minutes of this film and its relationship to Prometheus, I found it brilliant.I have read that Alvarez has been greenlit for another film which I am happy to learn. His effort definitely breathes life into the Alien movies and I for one am eager to see where he leads us to next, as I do have a sneaky suspicion.",2024-11-24
372,davebumpass,Alien Romulus: Confusion,1,"Let me start by saying I am a huge Ridley Scott fan. The original Alien is close to the top of the list as a favorite. I have waited a long time for Romulus, read as much as I could about it, while being careful to go in without knowing details (contradiction? Perhaps...). The movie starts off very confused, a group of young adult miners that suddenly have all the knowledge in operating spaceships? Too critical? Perhaps, so I continue. The movie is filled with wonderful acknowledgements of the original, many nods and references, all of which made me smile. A bunch of surprises that made me happy. The movie is layered and there are many great things about it....if you don't spend too much time acknowledging the missteps. The last straw, however, the one that ruined the entire movie for me was the ending, which completely rewrites the history, does something that shouldn't have been done and feels like the company ran out of money, so they threw something at the wall to see what would stick. Saw this on opening night, as I didn't want anyone around me to ruin/reveal anything, walked out of the theater angry for spending $17.50 on a movie that felt like a slap in the face. I sincerely hope the series is done, then I am reminded of the television series that's starting soon. I wont be watching.",2024-08-16
373,ruperto84,A ripping face hugging rollercoaster that eventually runs out of track and steam!,6,"Being an absolute die hard fan of Scott's ""Alien"" and Cameron's ""Aliens 2"" and having to endure the awful sequels and follow ups such as AVP! Although Promethus did spark something promising but the disappointing sequel of Covenant laid it all to rest. I was wondering how could Alveraz breathe new life into the Alien in Romulus. After seeing positive reviews and an ImDb rating of 7.5 and being a die hard sci fi/horror enthusiast I had to check it out and I never go to the cinema...like ever!I won't dive too much into the plot in this review however Alveraz takes us into a journey that is set between Alien 1 & 2 he takes the audience back into the world that is harrowing and bleak and sets the tone of Scott's world that he introduces us to.The horror of the face huggers coming at you in every direction brought me sheer delight and the chest burster scene with amazing use of light were every bit as gruesome and wonderful to watch! Also Alveraz brings back a familiar face with the use of CGI which brought back some great memories of the first Alien and the ruthlessness of the evil corporation of Weyland Yutani and some great ideas involving anti-gravity and acid!After a really strong 1st and 2nd act instead of allowing the Alien to breathe and stand alone as the antagonist we all know and love, we come into all to familiar territory and Alveraz decides to evolve the alien as done from previous sequels...unfortunately for me this did not work and left the anticlimax of the picture a bit flat...even though the cast were doing a great job of working with the characters and the alien. Upon further reading after watching the movie this was a direction that Disney advised the director not to take! Had Alvarez listened we may have had the strongest Alien film since Cameron's Aliens 2. Sooo close but no cigar!",2024-08-20
374,ivantumajr,Over-the-Top Roller Coaster Ride with AI Trolley Problems,8,If you enjoyed every Alien film for one reason or another - you're going to enjoy Romulus as well. The same thing that made this film fun is what will draw the most criticisms. I enjoyed the character development leading up to the action - there are hints of Blade Runner here as well. I would have maybe given this a 7 or even 6 stars until I realized the sheer amount of work put into this film. Lots of practical effects (or just very good CGI) - and a surprise cameo. You will enjoy this wild (if not gratuitous) ride. Some of the sequences are timely based on questions we're asking ourselves about AI today. The casting of Cailee Spaeny and David Jonsson in the lead roles won't disappoint even if you begin to feel like you're in a FPS video game towards the end.,2024-08-16

It might not be good as the other ones which are directed by Ridley Scott especially the first one from the early 1980s. I think I might prefer to Ridley Scott films but this one is alright for myself and I still like it though. It's a shame that Alien: Romulus isn't directed by Ridley Scott himself. I don't know why he hasn't involved in this latest Alien film.

This was only the second movie we have gone to see in the theater since the pandemic. The Regal theater we went to was really over the top with sound and digital screen for a great crisp picture. I would say my #1 out of the Alien films is Aliens. Next in line would definitely be Alien: Romulus.",2024-10-02
378,prhilmes-1,This one is now in my top 3 Alien movies,8,"Alien was a great suspense/horror movie. Aliens was great action. Alien: Romulus is both. Story-wise it doesn't have a lot of originality, but after 45 years of Alien movies, I wasn't expecting or necessarily wanting originality. I just wanted more of the good stuff - suspense, horror, and action with the Alien concept and this one delivers it in spades. The actors all do a serviceable to great job. I would have liked a little more time spent on developing the relationship between Rain and Andy and a little more exposition of some of the other characters to make them stand-out a bit more, but it still mostly worked. There are some small misses throughout the film, but are all mostly forgivable given the otherwise great ride the movie provides. If you liked either of the original Alien movies, you should like this one. They did an incredible job world building to the original's feel and they do a great job tying in this story with the other Alien movies with some minor exceptions where you might be like - hey, that doesn't make sense - but suspend your minor disbeliefs and move on. I really enjoyed how this movie ramped up the suspense and excitement as the movie progresses and really takes off in the third act. Highly recommended overall.",2024-08-21

Alien Romulus is a great movie, the feeling of suspense is constant and keeps you focused from beginning to end. This movie is a great example of how the use of practical effects can enrich not only the experience of the audience, but the actors' as well. I am pretty sure everyone at the movie teather got to feel what other people felt in 1979 watching the beginning of this master piece. I really hope the director continues with this as a fresh start for this amazing saga; it truly deserves it!",2024-08-18
381,kademan-40962,The imperfect organism,6,"Alien: Romulus is a confusing mess of a movie that seemingly starts out very straight forward, only to reveal a sharp turn down memory lane in revisiting familiar concepts from previous instalments.The set design is superbly constructed, with settings and props matching the futuristic 70s technology from the first two movies. The practical effects for the creatures from the facehuggers to the xenomorph are breathtakingly creepy. The score is a wonderful amalgamation of the franchise's best tunes and produces its own effective theme as well, although nowhere near as instantly recognisable. The opening two minutes is effective in establishing the mystery behind the premise as well as the vibe and tone. The facehuggers are made into a more present threat that adds to the tension rather than simply being reduced to 'step one of the xenomorph process'. There are also some good subtle easter eggs to previous instalments. The stand-out of the cast was easily David Jonson as Andy, giving a subtly threatening and simultaneously comforting performance.However, this film suffers not from its story, but it's characters inhabiting them. They are all pretty generic stereotypes with seemingly little-to-no effort put into their depth. The movie has a dicey third act that takes a risk that, although I appreciate, I ultimately don't like. But more than anything else, what this movie really didn't need, and would be better off without, were the unnecessary and downright cringe-worthy dialogue callbacks that ripped me out of the movie so fast it may as well have been whiplash.Overall, a mixed bag that although I liked its strengths more than I hated its flaws, just doesn't quite do the right things for me to believe this franchise has anything more to offer at this point.",2024-08-24

Loved the way things looked, they looked like how this movie would be made if it was truly made right after the 1st film the use of practical effects and chi was well balanced love as how much practical stuff was in this.

383,masonfisk,NOT BAD BUT IS IT ENOUGH...?,6,"The current Alien outing playing in theaters. Focusing on the time period between the first Alien film & Aliens, we have some bedraggled worker drones (which include Cailee Spaeney, Isabela Merced, David Jonsson from Rye Lane, Aileen Wu, Archie Renaux from Netflix' Shadow & Bone & Spike Fearn) who come w/a plan to enter a ship in the upper atmosphere whose orbit is degrading & steal their hibernation pods so they can ditch their work contracts (which is rewritten at whim to insure workers remain indentured) & pilot themsleves to a habitating world. Once on the ship, a further snag emerges as the pods need coolant which exposes them to some horrifying experiments w/our favorite xenomorphs which puts the enterprise on speed dial as it were before the ship blows up or the aliens have at'em. Coming from solid director Fede Alvarez (Don't Breathe/The Evil Dead remake) his final vision is at odds as his new wrinkles to the overall mythos are fun but the inclusion of some Easter egg faves upends (a returning CG'd android who spews exposition for some reason) whatever good will the audience affords him so strap yourself in for an entertainingly, frustrating time at the local cineplex. Maybe a cool deet, whether intended or not, is Jonsson's name Andy, which could be a reference to Philip K.

384,stevencsmovies,"My favourite in the franchise, ya I know!",9,"The ALIEN franchise has never really blown me away. Being a millennial, I started watching when PROMETHEUS came out, which was a pretty interesting and bold origin story. Director Fede Álvarez has now taken the reins with ALIEN: ROMULUS. Ridley Scott, now a producer, takes a backseat to let Fede do what he does best: unflinching tension. Bringing it back to the franchise roots, ROMULUS takes place between the original ALIEN and ALIENS, and is my favourite of the franchise. Before you tell me the first two are classics and basically changed the genre forever, HEAR ME OUT! Yes, the original two installments are classic, for that time. Watching them now like I did, it just doesn't do it for me. I can imagine if I saw those in the theater I'd have a different opinion, also time travel would be a thing. Anyway, this movie is about Rain (Cailee Spaeny), a young girl from a mining colony and Andy (David Jonsson), an android reprogramed to be her surrogate brother. In the hopes of finding a better life on another planet, they join a group of ragtag people with the same goal and sneak aboard a derelict ship to find working cryo-pods so they can make the 9-year journey. As you know this is an ALIEN movie, things don't go as planned. This movie blew me away. Phenomenal acting, at least from the 2 main leads. I've really enjoyed Cailee's performances. Just in the past year she's been in PRISCILLA, CIVIL WAR, and now this. She may look small, but she can be badass. David has the most to do performance-wise, which he nails. The sheer feeling of tension-filled claustrophobia is spot-on. The unique blend of practical effects and CGI is disturbing and perfect, except for one thing I can't talk about. The freakin sound design! A lot of people didn't really like the call-backs and references from the other installments, but I loved them. It takes a big swing in the third act, but I really enjoyed it. I've seen three movies from Fede now, and I've become a huge fan. ROMULUS actually has a LOT in common with another movie he made, but I'll let you figure that out on your own. Obviously I highly recommend ALIEN: ROMULUS, as it takes what was loved from the old and the new and mixes it all together in the ultimate ALIEN experience!",2024-08-19

This movie was more like paying to go on a bouncy castle for half an hour, fun but ultimately meaningless.Add to that that the horribly out of place quotes from previous movies said at the most non sanicle times by the most inappropriate characters and youve got a fairly fun and forgettable movie that is essentially ruined by poor decisions from the director and screen writers.",2024-08-22

The plot twists tighter than a facehugger's grip, and the scares are as relentless as the creature itself. The only thing more terrifying than the aliens?

But who needs logic when you've got acid-blooded monsters, space marines, and enough jump scares to keep your heart rate dangerously high for days?

391,Jithindurden,A nice alien horror and nothing more,6,"Every Alien movie before this had its own identity in one way or another (not really considering AvP films). But this one to me feels like it really didn't have anything of its own. It mainly felt like trying to make it feel a bit like the first Alien with a lot of influence from Prometheus but actually being closer to Alien Resurrection.What it set out to do did work pretty well. It's a pretty good alien horror that uses all the familiar beats. But it also feels like it tries a bit too hard to remind you of the other movies in the franchise with a lot of references. But trying to reference all of them kind of messes up the lore. The technology is made to seem more similar to the first Alien movie and there are solid reasons for it. Even in other ways, it is visually very much follows perfectly with the other films.But the way things happen, the timeline doesn't exactly add up. There are things that don't make sense for this to be set in between Alien and Aliens. Even if we disregard that, there is using Ian Holmes as the android, that's almost destroyed. Not only does it look worse than how a similar effect was used in 1979, but using that was completely unwarranted. It's not even the same character from the old movie. Using a dead guy's face like that just reminds me how Disney is going to be as bad as the evil Weyland-Yutani corporation in the movie. And this movie really tries to make a point of that.Overall, a nice alien horror movie that was a bit of a disappointment for me after hearing everyone praising it.",2024-09-05
392,CDW13,Alien: Romulus - A Familiar Yet Action-Packed Addition,6,"Alien: Romulus delivers solid action sequences and effective direction, with xenomorphs as terrifying as ever, though unfortunately underused. The film leans heavily on its characters, but the focus feels misplaced. Their arcs and dynamics are too familiar, offering nothing that truly stands out in the Alien franchise. Nostalgic Easter eggs are scattered throughout, but they feel more like surface-level nods than meaningful additions to the story. The last 20 minutes shift into an over-the-top conclusion that undermines the tension and grit that made the series iconic. While it's far from the worst in the franchise, it's certainly not the best. Sometimes, less is more, and not everything needs a ""bigger"" approach. Ultimately, it feels more like a generic sci-fi entry in a long list of many like it.",2024-11-23

Álvarez's expert use of lighting and sound amplifies the tension, creating an immersive and genuinely terrifying experience.

The practical effects bring a visceral quality, the pacing and sound score create a high anxiety ride - it's less ambitious than it's prequel forebearers and the plot beats given the entries into this franchise are not awfully surprising, placing it solidly in a middle territory in terms of said franchise.",2024-08-19

And then goes in a new direction. This film has been primed for a sequel, you can just see it. Similar to the ending of Aliens. I enjoyed this version. The acting was fine. The story was good. You can see all the parts of the first two films reenacted on the planet. The look of the film was perfect. The sense of terror was there. I didn't once feel like the film was slow. My other half jumped around a lot . I would recommend the film but it would be handy for others to rewatch the originals so as to have a balanced view.",2024-08-20
396,BlockLike,Flawed but solid,7,"As a longtime fan of the Aliens universe since I was a kid, I intentionally avoided all reviews and trailers before going to see it.Just for reference, I think everything after Alien 3 has been trash.The world depicted early on is very well done. A gritty, harsh and unwelcoming mining colony full of misery and regret.All of the set, costume and vehicle design follows suit and is great and fits in very well with the world being depicted.Despite that, the actual story being told there was a bit boring and left me not that interested in the time spent at the mining colony, which was a shame as it was visually excellent.The tension is immediately apparent as soon as they arrive at the main setting of the film.As far as the feeling of dread and being a 'jump scare' film, they got that aspect done quite well. Lots of claustrophobic environments, dark corridors, ominous sounds and strategic lighting.The casting was overall decent, with Andy being the strongest. He was played very well.One of my biggest plus points are the xenos. Lots of physical effects and actual costumes and animatronics. I was really worried it was going to be a badly done CGI fest, but I was really happy to see well done physical effects being the main approach.My only real compliant is how they concentrated too much on the relationship with Andy. It was just overdone at the sacrifice of the pacing of the film.I do think it was a relevant part of the storyline, but didn't needed to be focussed on as much as it was.Overall, a flawed but solid addition to the Alien universe.",2024-08-20
397,Anurag-Shetty,Lives up to the legacy of the original & its sequel.,9,"Alien: Romulus is set between the events of Alien(1979) & Aliens(1986). While thoroughly searching a run-down space station, space colonists Rain(Cailee Spaeny), Andy(David Jonsson), Tyler(Archie Renaux), Kay(Isabela Merced), Bjorn(Spike Fearn) & Navarro(Aileen Wu) face off against a malevolent & horrifying extraterrestrial monster.Alien: Romulus is an awe-inspiring film. Director Fede Alvarez has given us another masterpiece after Don't Breathe(2016). The action set pieces are mind-blowing & are even more immersive in IMAX. The tense atmosphere has been expertly maintained throughout & there are one or two well executed jump scares. The blood & gore amp up the shock value & are right in line with the other movies in the Alien franchise. The fact that practical effects & models were used for the titular creatures is phenomenal, in this day & age of excessive usage of CGI. Cailee Spaeny is spectacular as Rain. Spaeny is shaping up to be one of the most versatile actresses in Hollywood, with completely different roles in this film, Priscilla(2023) & Civil War(2024), just to name a few. David Jonsson is brilliant as Andy. Archie Renaux is amazing as Tyler. Isabela Merced is fantastic as Kay. Spike Fearn is good as Bjorn. Aileen Wu is superb as Navarro. Alien: Romulus is a must watch for fans of the Alien franchise. It matches up to the original & falls just slightly short of Aliens(1986). Watch it & have a pulse-pounding good time!",2024-08-29
398,gettodamoofies,"""Should be in and out in thirty minutes.""",7,"FILM: 6.5
Alien: Romulus is a film I approach with cautious optimism, especially with Fede Álvarez at the helm, given how he revitalised the Evil Dead series. Unfortunately, this attempt at breathing new life into the Alien franchise doesn't quite hit the mark for me. It's hard not to feel a bit sceptical these days, especially with AI and its influence on everything, including screenwriting. As I watch the storyline unfold, I can't shake the feeling that it's a blend of everything we've seen in the franchise before, like someone fed the scripts of all previous Alien films into ChatGPT and hit ""generate.""The movie starts off with a lengthy setup, which I actually appreciate. It builds some solid anticipation. Once we finally reach the titular station, the first encounter with the aliens is impressively done, bringing to mind the tense Med Lab scene from Aliens. The commitment to practical effects here is commendable and results in some of the best representations of the aliens that I've seen in years. But just as I'm getting into it, there's some really dodgy CGI for a specific character that feels like a bad deepfake. It's a frustrating contrast to the otherwise excellent practical effects.The cast is a bright spot, with Cailee Spaeny delivering a solid performance, particularly with the character development she's given. David Jonsson as Andy, however, steals the show. His character is not only the most compelling, but Jonsson's performance really deserves a nod. Sadly, the script doesn't do the actors justice, with some truly cringe-worthy dialogue callbacks to previous films. One of these lines is so ridiculous, I actually groaned out loud.Timing in the Alien franchise has always been a bit wobbly, but here it's downright ludicrous. At one point, the protagonists have 37 minutes to escape, which somehow results in aliens going through their entire maturation cycle in mere minutes-something that really took me out of the experience.The finale, sadly, is the film's biggest letdown. It borrows heavily from some of the least-loved aspects of earlier entries in the franchise, and while it's suitably horrific, it left me feeling more disappointed than anything.In the end, Alien: Romulus is a film that tries hard, but its missteps keep it from being truly great. The practical effects and early tension are commendable, but the numerous flaws knock it down several pegs.FORMAT: CinemaVIDEO: 10.0

399,Elvis-Del-Valle,A glorious return to space horror and an important contribution to the lore of the saga,9,"Fede Álvarez proved to be a good filmmaker in the horror genre with the Evil Dead remake and the Don't Breath saga. Although he didn't have much luck with the ninth installment of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre that was released on Netflix, it must be recognized that he has a good style for making this type of film. This seventh installment of Alien manages to put the saga in its place after Alien: Covenant was not so convincing. Even so, this film contributes a lot to the lore of the saga taking into account essential elements of the saga. Ridley Scott's participation in the production can be considered a good contribution and even compensation for him after Covenant.To begin with, this film is a solo story with different characters, but which connects directly with the first film. Here they explain what really happened with the xenomorph in the original film and at least clarify what the company's purpose was with this creature. It was always thought that the purpose was to use the xenomorph as a weapon, but it is clear that there was something else. There's a reason they insisted on studying them, no matter how risky it was. Alien: Romulus becomes an important piece to understand that. Fundamental elements of the saga that the film takes are the hybridization that is relevant to the birth of the xenomorphs and their biochemical material seen in Prometheus and Alien: Covenant. The film has very strange situations with the creatures, but taking into account what we've seen from Alien 3 to Alien: Covenant, the way the xenomorphs are engendered can vary depending on the genetic material they obtain through their hosts. In Prometheus they already gave a clue about the company's objective, which was to discover immortality with the Engineers' biotechnology. Alien: Romulus clarifies that quite a bit, and although it's not entirely explained how they obtained the facehuggers, the only thing that could be theorized is that it could somehow be linked to the end of Alien: Covenant.With respect to the film itself and its execution, we have to admit that it manages to be the terrifying update that the saga needed. In the settings, dialogues and scenes you can find some references to the previous films, especially the original. Not only does it have that suspense and tension that characterized the original film so much, but it offers a very horror-oriented atmosphere. It can be said that this is, to date, the scariest film in the saga. It doesn't have the gore and carnage of the third and fourth installments or Alien Vs. Predator: Requiem, but it has a lot of the intensity of the original film. Alien didn't have a lot of resources at the time, but it had managed to be an excellent film through suspense and subtlety. Alien: Romulus manages to do the same for much of its footage with few characters and a steady pace. The soundtrack even offers a very good atmosphere of terror and tension. You can appreciate the use of practical effects in some of them that manage to coexist with the good use of CGI. The xenomorphs were given a good balance between being fast and being stealthy.The final verdict is that Alien: Romulus is a worthy installment that adds a lot to the lore of the series and although some things may seem a bit repetitive, the film restores the saga to its integrity in an acceptable way after 7 years of inactivity. My final rating for this film is a 9/10.",2024-08-28

Weyland have evolved into the evil corporation we always knew they would become. The cast of actors did a really good job, AND they were very well cast in my view. Bringing in a definite horror dimension has been long overdue and this was executed really well. There are some flaws in the overall plot that unfortunately undermine the film for me.

Reminded me of when I saw Terminator Genesis and the audience laughed. That is a failure of the director considering the genre. The timing of it was also really poorly placed. Like it was for the Marvel type of audience, with bad humour. Also the fight at the end sucked. Thinking about it, this was due to an absolute lack of originality. It was basically the first 4 films mashed together. Looked great and was by no means bad. Just not great. Remove the 2 scenes that bothered me and it would be a 7.5 but still unoriginal.",2024-08-16
402,HabibieHakim123,"A Not Only Fills With An Exciting Xenomorph Action, And Badass New Lead Character, But Visually One Of The Most Stunning In Films This Year",8,"It's the best use of Xenomorph since Alien 3 for me and of course Aliens for many people, and in the name of Ellen freaking Ripley, even Ridley Scott couldn't possibly make this visually dazzling film with all the new technology, and that's when Fede Álvarez came on board, Alien: Romulus was indeed the most surprising visually stunning film of the year alongside the obvious Dune: Part Two, storywise what i don't really like about it was the limited information about this new sort of planet that this group was coming from and the destination that they're went, and so the first 20 minutes was just a flawed characters introduction, character Bjorn that was pretty meh, and David Jonsson as Andy that i'm not so sure at the beginning but he win me over eventually, and that's about it for my complain as the rest of Alien: Romulus was just basically fill with lots of great stuff, and again what helps the most is the fascinating visual in this movie that are just incredible, enough of that, the use of not only the Xenomorphs who never been this exciting and terrifying for many years, made me realise how they really wasting it in Covenant, but the use of the surprising reccuring character, and Cailee Spaeny as easily the second best lead in the Alien franchise, full of staggeringly creative intense build up, exciting face to face final battle with a twist at the end that i thought was a great yet shocking add to the film that i'm pretty sure will leave fans excited and happy, a nightmare to see yet fascinating to watch, i really like it, and so the majority of this film, once it born there is no escape from that point and it keeps going until the end and the film kept you lock in with it also, Alien: Romulus in my opinion is a great missing Alien sequel that we deserve 45 years in the making, a not only fills with an exciting Xenomorph action, and badass new lead character, but visually one of the most stunning in films this year.",2024-08-15

404,Pjtaylor-96-138044,You better be smellin' your armpit...,7,"'Alien: Romulus (2024)' is at its best when it's being its own thing, a pulpy space-set horror about a small crew coming into contact with the perfect killing organism. About 70% of the time, that's exactly what it is and it's honestly pretty great. Fede Alvarez knows what he's doing when it comes to atmosphere and suspense; there are several scenes that pull you to the edge of your seat and make your eyes widen in terror. There are some really goopy, unsettling and arresting sequences that really get their hands dirty in terms of showing just how gross a lot of this stuff really is (Facehuggers have never been so viscerally disgusting). I really appreciate how heavily the feature relies on practical effects, bringing a genuine weight and tangibility to its out-of-this-world creations that really heightens the tension. It's able to convincingly blend puppetry with digital doubles, and its environment feels like an actual place with dirt and grit and texture rather than something filmed primarily on a bluescreen. There is quite a bit of CGI, of course, but it's used more sparingly than you may expect and this actually enhances its effectiveness. The space scenes are as beautiful as they are eerie, aided by the quietly nostalgic score that sets the scene impeccably, and the gore is as artful as it is shocking. Aesthetically, the movie is downright gorgeous and it looks pretty much exactly as you'd want it to. It's a real treat to see and is something of a return to form for a series that I feel has lost its sense of style over the years. In the same vein, the narrative takes things back to basics and is far less concerned with ever-expanding lore (although that does come into play) than it is with insular, pressure-cooker storytelling focused on survival. While it is undeniably derivative, the plot never needed to be anything more than a compelling excuse for a group of people to come face to face with a Xenomorph; at its core, this is a high-grade B-movie, just like 'Alien (1979)' and 'Aliens (1986)', and it isn't interested in pretension.Unfortunately, it isn't all as fantastic as its best elements. About 30% of the time, it's far too focused on being a legacy sequel/prequel. It trips over its inheritance in an effort to pay homage to those that came before it, clumsily ticking boxes it assumes its fanbase is foaming at the mouth to see ticked. For some fans, that will do the trick. For me, it feels far too heavy-handed and semi-ceremonial. There are essentially two types of fan service at play here: the annoying but ultimately less bothersome moments designed to make you point at the screen and say ""they said the thing!"", and the more insidious reanimation of certain key aspects I won't spoil. The latter elements are certainly the more troublesome, as they're ethically iffy and actually pretty ghoulish, and perhaps the worst thing about them is that they're just not necessary. Outside of a few callbacks required to set the narrative up and establish it as taking place in the same universe/ continuity as the previous pictures, none of this jarring nostalgia bait is. Seriously, does this series really need to be Marvel-ised? Thankfully, the story itself mostly works as a standalone experience. It also veers further into its own territory during an extended epilogue that takes some really big swings. This segment is perhaps the most distinct in the entire affair, not for its narrative beats (which are as expected as anything else in the plot) but for its inclusion of a truly bizarre concept that's as upsetting to canon as it is to everyone else. Although the design of this element is undeniably creepy and would likely work really well in a horror movie not tied to a pre-existing series, it feels like a strange alteration to the lore the rest of the affair is so keen on keeping intact. It's sure to displease quite a few fans of the franchise, and it's a strange element to include considering how preoccupied the picture is with pleasing those same people elsewhere. I can't fault the affair for not playing it totally safe in its final moments, though, because I like to see that kind of franchise-be-damned thinking if it leads to interesting and fresh results. While I can't say I'm totally on board with everything in the epilogue (in fact, a lot of it outright doesn't work for me), I can say that I rather appreciate it.Ultimately, most of this movie is really good. It trips itself up whenever it tries to tie into its predecessors too tightly, and it also takes some swings that don't quite hit. A lot of it is really silly, but that's not actually a bad thing. It's really enjoyable for its majority, with a compelling aesthetic and some truly pulse-pounding sequences. Its practical effects are delightful, too. Although a few of its characters could have done with perhaps being a bit more likable (or, rather, easy to root for), the picture does a good job at getting you invested relatively early on, primarily thanks to its expert direction and palpable atmosphere. It may take quite a while for the eponymous alien to actually show up, but the pacing is mostly appropriate and the Xenomorph is as worth the wait as its ever been. It's an entertaining effort that, despite its flaws, is easily the third best movie in its series.",2024-08-21
405,rbrt_gilchrist,Alien is back baby!,9,"Alien: Romulus is a very welcome return to the Alien universe. Following the long established rules featuring a haunted house and things that go bump in the dark.Pros: * The sound and production design are 100% authentic to the films Alien and Aliens. The amount of physical sets, practical creatures and model work makes what we are seeing so much more real and alive.* The tension in this film continues to tighten and tighten as their situation becomes more like an impossible trick shot throwing a basketball out of a moving car, over the side of a bridge and through the hoop below.* A great support cast of up and coming actors who, while they have certain tropes, make the most of what they have... Mostly.Cons: * The film does have a few moments where you recognized where something has been lifted from a previous film. While not actually a bad thing, it could take you out of the film somewhat, especially one moment.* There was probably an overuse (not that many) of jump scares where it undercut building that feeling of dread that was so successfully done in Alien and Aliens.* The film has a very small cast which may not pay off on the appetite for the modern day horror fans body count.Cailee Spaeny's character Rain is the films heart along with David Jonsson's 'Andy'. They keep the story grounded while their goals keep shifting between them throughout the film. If you're a fan of the series you'll find yourself smiling from time to time.P.s.

406,ThereelscoopwithKK,Familiar But It Works Well Enough,7,"In many ways this film is a return to the roots of the franchise, and for that reason I would say it was a success. While there are many parts of it that aren't explained quite well enough and the setting in general at the start is very poorly developed, it does hit on the parts it needs to in order to provide the excitement you expect going into it. You could certainly describe it as a slow burn, in other words you have to stick with it to reap the rewards. The story does eventually use all it built up throughout to produce a somewhat exciting ending.Still, although it is better than some of the other installments , the acting is fairly average, and there are no particular scenes that will stick with you for more than a few days to a week later. For me at least , this makes it more in the acceptable class of movies as opposed to a good or even great movie.

407,paul-allaer,More isn't the same as better,6,"As ""Alien: Romulus"" (2024 release; 119 min) opens, we are on ""Jackson Star's Mining Planet, 65 LY From Earth"", and we are introduced to a young woman named Rain. Rain finds out that the owners of the mine have unilaterally extended her contract for another 12,000 days. Rain and a small group of friends are desperate for a way out, any way out... At this point we are less than 10 min into the movie.Couple of comments: this latest entry in the Alien franchise of movies is directed by Uruguayan director Fede Alvarez (""Don't Breathe"", ""The Girl In the Spider's Web""). Arriving exactly 45 years after the first ""Alien"", one wonders if any angle remains open to bring new life to this franchise. Without spoiling any of the movie' s plot, I think that I can say that the difference between 1979 and 2024 is that today's technology makes it so much easier to have not 1 (as in the original ""Alien""), not 2, not 3, but countless ""monsters"" on the screen. But all it does for me is to wonder whether ""more"" is ""better"", and we all know the answer to that. There isn't a single scene in this movie that will terrify you like some scenes of the original ""Alien"" did. That doesn't mean there aren't some good points to this movie. In particular the last half hour is non-stop action.""Alien: Romulus"" opened this past weekend in US theaters, and did OK at the box office. What really surprised me is that this is currently rated 81% Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes. That is what ultimately convinced me to check this out. The early evening Discount Tuesday XD screening at Cinemark Oakley here in Cincinnati was not attended well: roughly 10-12 people.

412,donutepetrisor-75375,"It wasn't bad, but it could be better!",9,"The movie wasn't bad but:
a) Cailee Spaeny is too childish for this role in Alien Romulus even though she is 26 years old!!! Making a comparison with Alien I, then Sigourney Weaver was about 30 years old, however, Sigourney Weaver had a charisma much more suited to the role. Lately I've been noticing movies with actors who are too childish, it's not good, I know that the main target is children because they spend the most time in front of the TV or come to the cinema, but let's not become embarrassing with such scenarios with children!!B) The theme of the film was not very bad, however, compared to Alien I.... IV, in this Alien Romulus the hatching of the alien from the body of the host happened very very quickly - I think in less than 6 hours, which in other Alien versions took in 24...48 hours. I won't mention here the embarrassing phase when Alien Romulus becomes mature in about 24 hours!!!! Wtff!!! Here they kind of screwed up with the script!!!C) I think that the development of another set of Alien films starting from Alien Romulus is being followed, but the way this was done, it was not done in the best way!!! I watched the movie at the cinema and I think it's missing something. First of all, I don't think the best actors were chosen to play in this movie!!! Other actors with other charismas think they were more suitable. The biggest mistake is the fact that only children are chosen to act in films in some roles where in the real world you should be at least 35 years old... 40 years old to fulfill them. I'm not saying that it wasn't good to have one or two children along with other mature actors, but it's downright embarrassing for 7 children (""20 years old"") to pilot a ship and fly through the cosmos like that on their own and when they meet an Alien makes him face like in a PC game !!! This is downright embarrassing and for this reason I only gave this film 9 stars, but with great indulgence.",2024-08-16
413,josephbannister,Pretty good,7,"Tbh I'm actually surprised in the direction the film went and the lack of gore in comparaison to the horror film genre nowadays. It took on a feel similar to that of the original , and there is a small detail that I find should be cleared, it cannot take place after the original alien, it must take place after the second film. You may be asking why, we'll that's due to the Queen alien and her reproductive capabilities. There are quite a few xenomorphs onboard and the only way that would be possible is that they retrieved the Queen who was frozen in space after the second film and in regards to that it would of surely made more of an impact on me if she was présent in the film. Asides from that I rather enjoyed the film and its direction and the characters involved. If your looking for a gorefest you won't find it here asides from à few chestbursters and tge élongation of the month from the alien onto à humans face. As I said the film is quite good so go into it with no exoectations asides from it's an installment into the alien franchise and there are a few easter eggs for the fans in regards to prometheus and convenant. It is différent In style of filmmaking compared to those two and has a much more practical and similar feel to that of the original. I reccomend it to any of the franchise fans, it was an entertaining movie, would I watch it again? Maybe in a year or 2 or if I décidé to Binge watch the franchise in entirety again.

415,Parsa-Eshtelaq,A good movie but way too overhyped,7,"The movie ""Alien: Romulus"" is another movie inside of the Alien universe. I've never watched or been interested in watching any of the previous movies, but I went and watched this one and therefore it was my first alien movie... And I was spooked and fairly intrigued throughout the movie, but it is still overhyped.From what I've heard and read Alien: Romulus follows the same formula for its story as its predecessors. Humans are just way too curious into something they shouldn't. But hey... That's typical human nature. But nonetheless this movie does provide an interesting story for what is a direct sequel to the original movie from 1979 according to timeline. So you will find a lot of easter eggs. First act is a bit slow but the second and third act is everything you would imagine from an Alien movie.In terms of scariness... It was very scary at times for me and I even jumped at a couple jumpscares. So you're warned.The cast did great. I really need to praise the performance from David Jonsson, who plays Andy. He played his role so well and he was personally my favourite character. Along with David, I would say that Cailee Spaeny as Rain (lead) also shows that she is one for the future. Not only did she do well in the movie ""Civil War"" but this time as the lead she does great. The rest of the cast were alright as well.Anything from soundtrack, costumes and everything in-between... I would say was okay.The CGI and everything they used to make this realistic was good at times... But you could see flaws here and there. But they've made the Xenomorph pretty well.From what is an alright plot with some great performances and some good CGI work... I would give this movie a score of 7/10.",2024-08-23

It builds up a little slow, but catching all the references as a fan, was fun.The use of audio is extremely solid as well. Silence is used fantastic trough the film. And the music cues as well.When the action/horror starts it doesnt stop, and the last act made me smile.

417,akoaytao1234,Same Old Formula with a Great Ending,7,"A bunch of 'slave' miners in Saturn try their luck by locating an old abandoned spaceship containing 'cryonic stasis chambers' for their journey back to their home. What awaits is another scream that no one can hear.I personally think that this still takes far too much of the bad Slasher Hijinxs that I tend to frown upon of the Alien Series. Again, a bunch of hyper-emotional and impulsive set of characters try to out-dumb themselves and set a monster to kill them with no mercy. Though, in this iteration - they set the record straight on how can this happen yet again. They are more of a not-so-good space pirates.Performance wise, I think I like Spaeny here. She really has a good streak of film choices that while I am not thoroughly impressed - shows an eye for good performances. She is impressive here and really put on her shoulder the final moments of the film. Did not care for the supporting cast. They were practically throwaway reminder that they are not good space explorers.But I just want to talk specifically of the ending. It just hits all the right spot. I will not spoil anything but when it focused heavily on Spaeny - it just works far better. This is the direction the film should set on. A battle for actual survival not a kumbaya sentimental slasher.Also, a bit of negative - far too much reference from the original film. I am not the biggest fan of the film but it can get far too on the nose.Recommded.",2024-08-16

The set was reminiscent of the first Alien movie, this was totally true to the feeling and premise of the first one. Would see it again and this is a movie that should be seen in the theaters.Having a female heroine is something that this series is known for, and this installation of the franchise stays true to the original theme.

And oh boy I was not disappointed, I would arguably say this is the best Alien movie of all time, pretty much everthing was perfect, The sound design perfect, the acting perfect, the practical effects, perfect!!! This movie is now another one of my favorite horror movies of all time and I'm so excited to buy it and rewatch it. The Actors where so good, and the callbacks to the original where awesome and I loved it! I can't wait to watch Aliens, and Prometheus after watching this, but this movie is in my opinion pretty much impossible to beat. Fede Álvarez Did an amazing job and I loved every second of it.

I was young, at a friend's house and their parents let them watch whatever they wanted. I remember thinking this film isn't that great but the alien is awesome. A few years on I watched Alien and Aliens and they were such great movies I must've watched them over and over. Since those the rest of the films just didn't cut it for me and then the AVP movies were just awful. If you liked the originals you will love Romulus. I went in with no expectations as most new films in beloved classics just can't reach the same potential, but they got everything right here. The aesthetic style and look, the practical effects, the tension, face huggers a plenty and of course aliens 👌🏻 It starts slow but once it gets going it doesn't stop 💀",2024-08-16
421,ObsessiveCinemaDisorder,"A fun Alien movie with 2 strong leads and innovative set pieces, but doesn't go anywhere new.",7,"As the ninth film in the franchise, Alien: Romulus is as entertaining and fresh as an Alien sequel can be.Colony workers Rain Carradine and her adoptive android brother Andy discover their work contract on LV-410 has been forcibly extended by the Weyland-Yutani corporation.The siblings join a group of workers and hatch a plan to retrieve cyrostasis chambers from a derelict space station, thus allowing far-distance space travel to their home planet Yvaga...Writer-director Fede Alvarez, director of Don't Breathe and the 2013 Evil Dead remake, approaches the material as a labor of love, employing practical effects and innovative action sequences in the spirit of upping the ante and returning to the franchise's roots.The Alien franchise has run its course since James Cameron's Aliens. The audience is aware of the Xenomorph's life cycle, eliminating any possible suspense, and there's just no way to bypass that, period.As a passionate fan of the series, Fede Alvarez works hard to incorporate elements from all the Alien films, even Prometheus. Like the Xenomorph absorbing elements of its host body, the final product is a hodgepodge of familiar elements that plays its hand too safe.Fortunately, there are more hits than misses.Cailee Spaeny and David Jonsson are charming and memorable leads that the audience cares about and root for. The human-android sibling relationship is affecting and is the heart of the piece. I am pining for a sequel just to see their story continue.The practical effects approach was effective, giving weight to the environment, which blended beautifully with the cinematography. The Facehuggers, as practical puppets, were far creepier than the Xenomorphs. I wished more films would go back to practical effects.The action set pieces are creatively designed, like levels in a fantastic unmade Alien video game that brilliantly plays with the established rules of the Xenomorph.As for the misses, the film features an actor from the original Alien as a full CGI creation, like Grand Moff Tarkin from Rogue One. The computer effects of recreating a person's face remains stranded in the uncanny valley. Against the backdrop of the film's realistic sets, the CGI character's plastique look was unnecessarily distracting.The famous line uttered by Sigourney Weaver's Ellen Ripley is quoted in the most toe-curling forced manner. I squinted...and the sting kept drilling into me until I had an epiphany: Easter eggs are not cool anymore.Romulus illustrated the fine line between linking the world building details from previous movies and just straight out re-enacting iconic moments. I loved how Alvarez linked the details from the other films but when he re-enacted iconic moments from the series, it felt like there was a huge missed opportunity in pushing the series forward to new places.As fun as it all is, the same core issue for the Alien franchise remains: the audience still need to be taken somewhere new.",2024-10-12

I haven't been this scared since the conjuring 2 so yeah I'm more than satisfied on that aspect of the film. This is a horror movie where you actually care about the characters lol.

Believe me when I tell you, this is the well deserved movie we old school fans were looking for: and it hit the spot. The movie was just ""Lit"". Good character development: check. Good cinema score: check. Good original Alien ambient world: check. The space ships, technology, and instruments in this movie still resembled the outdated technology Ridley Scott worked with back in 1979. Which was just so nostalgic, but the director of the movie didnt just rely on nostalgia to deliver. Fun action packed and true to its roots.

433,Field78,"A love letter to the series, perfectly in between nostalgia and innovation",9,"A director who voluntarily accepts the task of making a new installment to a classic sci-fi franchise must be both self-assured/crazy enough to think he can make a worthy addition, and brave enough to weather a storm of potentially offended fans. By setting an interquel (in-between sequel) between Alien and Aliens, Romulus has no less than two acclaimed masterpieces to contend with (and even Alien 3 is getting more praise over the years). Volunteers, anyone?So enter Fede Alvarez, whose Evil Dead reboot already showed that a remake of a classic original doesn't have to be a poor derivative with a lack of fresh ideas, blood and gore, and who demonstrated his keen eye for squeezing maximum suspense from a tight surrounding in Don't Breathe. Together with co-writer Rodo Sayagues, he has the chops to build up Alien Romulus from the elements that made the original trilogy work, while at the same time having the imagination to come up with new stuff that make this a tense and riveting action-thriller ride that still feels like it organically belongs within this movie series, rather than a totally different franchise.One thing that the creative team has understood well is that the real villain of the Alien series isn't necessarily the titular creature but the nefarious Weyland-Yutani company; even when hiding behind the face of synthetics... excuse me, artificial persons, their relentless greed and disregard for human lives have always been the source of all the ordeals that their employees must suffer. So we are back in Weyland-Yutani's heyday, where a group of young colonists are trying to escape their poor living conditions and the Company's tight economic clutches (no lack of contemporary metaphors here) by attempting a daring escape to a better life through an abandoned Company space station. However, as per series tradition, this Romulus/Remus station is not as empty as it seems, and as they realize what has happened, they need to run for their lives for the facehuggers and Aliens that infest the station.The last two prequels of the series, Ridley Scott's Prometheus and Alien Covenant, went more into the direction of large-scope, grand philosophical ideas rather than a battle for survival on a small scale, something that was clearly not appreciated by large parts of the fanbase. Although I liked them, Romulus is a great return to the creature-feature roots of the series, with some nail-biting suspense set in very grim retro-futuristic areas full of metal and exposed wiring. In promotional material, the makers have been very proud of their largely practical approach to set design and special effects, and rightly so. This feels like a lived-in world where the scares, threats and action feel very real and the creatures deliciously icky, wonderfully supported by some CGI touches without overdepending on them. My only comment would be that the facehuggers sometimes seem a bit like sluggish robots, but that is a small price to pay for a nice old school approach that helps create such a tense and pleasantly nostalgic atmosphere.I am even more impressed with how this movie connects with the original films, and marries their monster movie tropes to the more cerebral cautionary tales from the prequels. There are artifical persons in the movie that play key roles in the story, perfectly underlining the dangers of poorly controlled AI from the prequels; there is even a link with Prometheus that puts the Company's desire for the Xenomorphs (and thus the original films) in a somewhat new light, making Romulus a welcome connective tissue since we will probably no longer get that third prequel. Undoubtedly, those who disliked Scott's prequels will have issues with these plot elements. But that's the way it is.Again, part of making a successful follow-up, I think, lies in a balanced combination of the old with the new. There are fresh faces from a great cast (with a breakout performance by David Jonsson), but there is one familiar face that firmly and organically cements this film within the series legacy without feeling like fan service. Neither do Alvarez and his team forget to give us the adrenaline ride that Aliens was famous for, with a few original action scenes that I had always wanted to see in an Alien movie (one with lots of facehuggers, and one in zero G), and will hopefully become iconic over the years. Alvarez can thank Ron Cobb for coming up with the Aliens' acidic blood, because I daresay that this staple of the series has rarely been used more effectively than here. All in, a spectacular white-knuckle ride that uses all the modern tools for film-making, but keep things reasonably grounded in the realism of the series.If I have one major comment, it would be the final confrontation. Though a solid and tense climax, the makers allowed themselves to implement an outlandish idea that I found reminiscent of Alien Resurrection. Not necessarily bad (I am of the minority that likes that movie), but I found it slightly over the top and thinking that the film would have also been fine without it. But that is not a bad score in a movie where the story otherwise supports the memorable scenes quite well, rather than just functioning as scaffold for a series of highlights.This is an Alien movie that every fan should see. As always, there will be detractors (Aliens, my favorite in the series, has them too). No doubt that some will find it too derivative still, or too alienated from the source (pun intended). I am quite confident that many fans will like how this movie walks that fine line between the familiar and the unfamiliar. Scott and James Cameron are fans, and so am I. I hope to discuss, celebrate and analyze this one in detail on line for the years to come.",2024-08-16
434,Matthew0725,A taste of everything I love about Aliens,9,"OK, first of all, all the people that are hating on this movie because it ""wasn't original"" or had too many throwbacks, how ridiculous are you guys?! For any fan of the Alien franchise, how can you possibly go into a new movie after 8 others and not expect to have any fan service? I for one appreciated the heck out of the fan service. Those little Easter eggs were a lot of fun in my humble opinion. So for all the people hating for those reasons, get a grip and learn how to have fun with a movie.As for me, I thought this was a great movie. Does it pull elements from other horror stories? Of course it does. But does it have its own original concepts and ideas? Also yes. Some of those ideas were so masterfully executed and a thing of gruesome beauty to behold. Like all of these movies, there were certainly characters that you could easily predict would be taken out pretty early on. You were just hoping they got a pretty wicked sendoff, and you got exactly that. Some pretty gnarly deaths in this movie. Utilizing a very young cast - which was a risk - of relatively unknown actors/actresses, I was really impressed with the acting. The dynamic between the main character and her ""brother"" had a fantastic arc that changed throughout the course of the movie, and eventually came full circle in a beautiful way. One particular scene in this movie involving gravity, or the lack thereof, was so freaking cool. One of those ""original"" concepts.Is it a perfect movie? No. But it's pretty darn close. I really only have two criticisms. I didn't really buy how the crew of characters wound up on the ship with the aliens in the first place. Seemed a bit contrived. And the movie is guilty of having too many endings. But I will say, the second ending did build up to something pretty wild, so I was ultimately OK with it.For me, the haters are off, I give this a 9/10.",2024-08-17

On the contrary, we have quite disturbing themes relating to sex, birth and deviance that I'm sure Giger would be quite trilled with.Pacing was good, the movie never seemed to get bogged down and it spent the runtime well, lingering when appropriate, but not wallowing.In total, I haven't seen a better Alien movie in a some time, and while we didn't get drastic new elements like with Prometheus, I felt like this was a movie more true to the original duet, and with more authentic and enjoyable DNA.",2024-11-22

441,zornzk,A Review from an Alien Franchise SME,9,"I have read a lot of so-so reviews on this movie and it is perplexing. None more so than a review I read that indicated this film was made by fans of the franchise who don't understand the franchise.As a person who has read nearly the entire Alien canon (every novel, nearly every comic book including the originals, the dark horse releases and the new releases by marvel), played virtually every alien game that has been released, and seen every alien movie an embarrassing amount of times, I can say whole heartedly that this is an amazing addition to the franchise as a whole.I'm not a big fan of leaving spoilers in reviews but my overall thoughts on the movie are as follows:1) The cinematography is exquisite. The way Alien: Romulus is shot is simply wonderful. The scenes are framed great, the color profile and visual mood do justice to the overall return to horror, and the blending of the practical and digital effects are refreshing in a genre that often struggles to blend the two.2) The fact that it is a return to horror for the franchise was well overdue. Fede Álvarez is no stranger to the genre and this is yet another notch in his horror belt.3) Adding to the ever evolving lore of the franchise. While I understand a lot of fans of the franchise weren't happy with the direction taken by the previous 2 installments bringing in the Engineer's and the concept of the pathogen, they are here to stay now being so steeped in the expanded universe. Romulus took this and made a very interesting movie that marries the xenomorphs of the past with the somewhat maligned origins of the alien pathogen created by the Engineers and perfected by David in Alien Covenant.If you have the ability to deal with change and evolution when it comes to franchises you grew up with, then there is no reason to not enjoy this movie. However, if you are a person who doesn't want the established lore that you grew up with to change at all, this may not be for you (although, you should have given up by Prometheus, if not Alien Resurrection).I hope this review helped you decide to watch this extremely entertaining addition to the franchise with an open mind!",2024-10-17
442,davidmanning-31368,"Poor first half, much better second half",6,"I was excited to watch this movie given some reports that it is the best in the series since Aliens. That excitement soon faded once the movie started. About 40 minutes into the film I was even considering leaving the cinema. Mainly this was due to the terrible sound mixing rendering most of the muffled dialogue incomprehensible. Given that the first half of the movie is slow moving anyway this made for a very boring watch. Admittedly I have partial hearing loss, but this isn't usually a problem for me in cinemas and my wife who has perfect hearing said she also struggled.The film did improve significantly in the second half. Not that the dialogue was any clearer, just that it didn't matter given that it is all action. The practical effects, cinematography and action sequences are all top notch in the second half of the film.The director nails the feel of an Alien film perfectly but at the same time this means that there is nothing new or original to see here. Lots of call backs to previous films are present, but these feel forced and unsatisfying.Sadly whilst Romulus is an improvement on Covenant, and a very effective action movie in the second half, it is still just a rehash of better films that have come before. For me it was a poor watching experience in the first half and an enjoyable Aliens homage in the second half so a score of 6 feels about right overall.

443,timeblank,My Expectations Were Wrong and I'm Glad,9,"I initially expected *Alien Romulus* to be a total flop, but I was pleasantly surprised by how well it was made. Sci-fi horror often disappoints, but the direction and execution here were nothing short of amazing. The cinematography was stunning, and the practical effects were incredibly well done. I didn't expect the film to have such a compelling story and clear motivations, but it delivered on both fronts. The scenes with zero gravity and acid blood were particularly impressive. The buildup of tension throughout the movie was expertly handled, and the performances by the new cast members were outstanding. My first experience with the *Alien* franchise was *Alien vs. Predator*, which I found underwhelming, but *Alien Romulus* completely changed my perspective. I was absolutely captivated by it.",2024-08-17
444,sfalkyb,A lost opportunity that needed better acting and script,6,"Excellent set design and world-building, the spaceship was fantastic and looked very much like the Nostromo. Scenes shot from outside of the ship were excellent, the planetary ring was beautiful, the spaceships look realistic with such intricate detail. What put me off was some second-rate acting, having a colonist with a British accent and an abysmal script. There are no memorable quotes in this film (game over man, put her in charge, we just lost Dallas). I didn't mind that the computer noises, air ducts and screens echoed those of the Nostromo, but I did mind the unneeded references to Alien/Aliens. And the unbelievably hesitant Aliens was just odd. And why in the age of hyper speed travel do all the onboard cameras have 480p resolution? In Alien, when Brett/Parker/Lambert/Dallas got smoked it had impact. Here, I don't even remember their names. The mini-Ripley actress was good. Same with the android. Would I watch again in the cinema. No. Would I see in on TV. Probably.",2024-08-28
445,mikeyweil035,A fantastic new film to the franchise,9,"This was one of my most anticipated films of the year and boy did it hold up. It also lead me down a deep nerd rabbit hole. One I haven't been on in years. Since maybe even the Cloverfield days. I watched Alien I-IV, Promethesus, Alien: Covenant, and both Alien vs. Predator films prepring for this movie. I also started playing Alien: Isolation, a game I bought years ago and had been sitting on my shelf. And I spent a good amount of time on Reddit learning more about Wayland enterprises, the comics, the novels and so on.I went opening night, on Thursday. I was able to get the popcorn bucket with the facehugger on it. The employee asked if I wanted the popcorn in the bucket or not. I didn't even know that I had that option!A lot of the reviews that I read about the movie said that it felt like a video game. And I guess it did, in a way. Because I had just played the game and the movies took place inbetween Alien and Aliens. I also read a lot of reviews that said the movie just felt like it rehashed from previous movies. While it did pay homage to previous movies it alsoFede Alvarez must have had a good time working on this film because he would like to make an Alien vs. Predator sequel and split directorial duties with Dan Tratchenberg who directed Prey, the most recent Predator film.Also, an Alien television series is headed to FX for Hulu next year.

446,WhipEliotLash,8.5/10 - A love letter to Alien and the first great Alien movie in the 21 st century,9,"This is a well made sci-fi, like really well made. Finally we get an Alien movie from a director that understands the franchise.The director and the team behind the scenes should be proud of their creation. I will start commenting of the visuals. Visually, this movie is absolute perfection retaining the retro 80's tech aesthetic (pure candy for fans of the first 2 Alien movies), use of practical effects (Alien costumes and robotics) and great looking CGI in scenes where it should be used: in space and on other planets and the immersion is there. I am impressed by the attention of detail and the amount of work they have made behind the scenes. I predict this movie will age decently thanks to this. Simply 10/10 in this aspect.I should also quickly comment on the score and audio. I was pleasantly surprised by the movie using a score that was reminding of the first Alien movie. It may sound unoriginal but it was positive, I cannot put my finger on it exactly but it was like it was using the same ""canvas"" (probably using a similar orchestra). It effectively used silence in several moments as well and it was a special experience in at the cinema and the whole audience was silent in these moments. Tech and gun sounds also had the satisfying retro sound effects, nice!Now to the actual movie: There are many good points that has been made from other reviewers but I must stress how I was impressed by how this director successfully incorporated elements from every single Alien movie making the ultimate love letter to the Alien franchise. He does not only incorporate elements from the classics (Alien and Aliens) but even sprinkles in elements from the less successful ones (Alien 3, Alien 4, Prometheus, Alien Covenant, but NOT Alien vs Predator movies) and from the latter he picks out the best parts from these movies or refines them slightly respectfully paying them homage as well. All the while preserving a well rounded, but admittedly simplistic, sci-fi horror story and we have the first *great* Alien movie in the 21 st century in my opinion.There are some great set pieces in this film that I found clever and innovative with thrilling action and characters you root for and you will know what scenes I mean when you have seen the film.The movie goes back to its roots in critical areas: working class characters vs corporate greed, isolated spaceship, body horror and humanity in androids. The actors overall does a fine to good job and the characters work for the story, but most of them does not have a lasting impact on the audience and I cannot remember their names (compared to iconic characters from Alien and Aliens). This is not true however for the actor playing the android who is superb in this role in par with previous android characters in the franchise (which includes amazing performances in Alien, Aliens and Alien Convenant). Why are the android characters so memorable from this franchise?Further negative criticism of this movie lies in pacing in the final act and some over reliance on the classic instalments (Alien and Aliens). I got pretty worn out by the end because it was intense for a long time. There are some lines used that are a callback to previous instalments and it was too much ""on the nose"" or ""4th wall winking"" breaking immersion.Other stars:
* Body horror does NOT hold back and this is GREAT but viewer discretion is strongly adviced! The body horror in Alien is central and based on the art of Giger but it is also derivative from sex, rape and fear of pregnancy.* The intro sequence.* The score from Prometheus was loaned in one scene, a subtle nod.* A character from a previous Alien movie made an appearance from a deceased actor, even though the face was uncanny valley, the recreated voice was on point.* Effective use of Chekhov's Gun.It is probably quite clear by now that I am a huuuge fan of the Alien movies and I really enjoyed seeing this movie at the big screen. I hope future directors take inspiration from what they achieved in this movie and we can get more like this, Alien or not. I find it a 8.5/10, thus rating a 9.",2024-10-07
447,drrogers84,"A Ripley Good Time, but a Bit of a Rip-Off",6,"Lets start with the positives:""Alien: Romulus"" delivers a thrilling blend of action and suspense that pays homage to its iconic predecessors. Under Fede Álvarez's direction, the film effectively captures the eerie ambiance of the original Alien and the adrenaline-pumping action of Aliens. The practical special effects and meticulously crafted miniatures are a refreshing change from the usual CGI overload, offering a tangible sense of realism. The Xenomorphs are depicted with impressive detail, and the space sequences are visually stunning. The careful use of CGI complements the practical effects without overshadowing them, creating a visually rich experience.Negatives:However, ""Alien: Romulus"" isn't without its flaws. The acting, while adequate, fails to leave a lasting impression, and the film's story relies heavily on nostalgic references that can feel more like a trip down memory lane than a fresh narrative. The dialogue echoes lines from the better Alien films, which feels more like a forced nod to the past than a creative decision. The inclusion of lore elements from the less well-received prequels further detracts from the experience, and the reveal of the villain feels underwhelming and clichéd.The film's attempt to fit into the established continuity between Alien and Aliens feels constrained by the need to adhere to existing plot points and references. This creates a ""remember-berries"" effect that may disappoint long-time fans and newcomers alike. Rather than moving forward, the film seems to be stuck in a cycle of nostalgic callbacks and recycled dialogue.Ultimately, ""Alien: Romulus"" stands as an above-average entry in the franchise-enjoyable for its visual and action sequences but hindered by its reliance on past glories and a somewhat lackluster story. It ranks as the fifth-best film in the series, missing the opportunity to be a standout instalment due to its over-reliance on familiar elements.",2024-09-14

But thankfully, this breathes a lot of fresh air into a much beloved franchise. I love the alien movies - they are the pinnacle of horror and I firmly believe that the Xenomorph is the pinnacle of a horror creature. This movie manages to pay homage to the original, while injecting enough fresh monstrousness to keep the movie exciting and surprising. Finally also the characters are very interesting, and I really rooted for Rain - the actress playing her does an amazing job. Very tense in parts, very scary overall. A really refreshingly fantastic entry. And no spoilers, but the final 30 minutes - INSANE and so memorable.",2024-09-03
450,jaredpahl,Alien on Easy Mode,7,"I have a hard time imagining the pitch for Alien: Romulus as anything but ""Let's do a Gen Z remake of Alien"". Fede Alvarez' movie brings very little else to the Alien franchise other than its young cast, but the man behind a few other horror remakes again gets the fairly easy job done.If there is any plot, so to speak, to consider in Alien: Romulus, it's buried under heaps of boilerplate sci-fi gobbledygook in the first chunk of the film. A small crew of space miners (an attractive, enthusiastic group of movie newcomers) come up with a scheme of some kind to commandeer an abandoned ship and take it somewhere sunny. And that's about all the background I can recall before we get to the good stuff.Romulus has none of the big ideas or pretensions of Ridley Scott's prequels. No grand mysteries or myth-making ambitions. It's a group of kids in over their heads against our old friends the facehuggers, chestbursters, and Xenomorphs. With those easy aims, Alvarez comes up with a very exciting creature feature. There are a million ways this concept could have gone wrong, but Romulus avoids just about all of the modern horror pitfalls. This is, for one, a great looking movie. Even in the traditional Alien darkness and grime, the set design and the action therein is kept clear and purposeful. The characters, who might have easily become unforgivably irritating mouthpieces, are actually fine company. I wouldn't call any of them, even Cailee Spaeny, stars in the making, but they make perfectly good Xeno bait.Is there any creative reason for Alien: Romulus to exist? No. Does it expand the franchise in any meaningful way? Absolutely not. Is it as artful and thrilling as any of Ridley Scott's or James Cameron's Alien movies? It isn't. But Romulus is still a whole lot of fun in a Friday night chiller sort of way, and for an Alien fan, it satisfies all those things we love about the world Scott and Cameron cooked up so many years ago.73/100.",2024-08-23
451,giorgiobrugnone,Alien Romulus: A Visceral Return to the Franchise's Dark Roots,10,"Alien Romulus is like surviving 10 brutal rides on the worst rollercoaster in hell. You stagger out, dazed and anxious, relieved it's finally over, yet buzzing with adrenaline. This film is a powerful and masterfully crafted experience, with top-tier music and effects that elevate it to something truly special.In many ways, it's a triumphant return to the franchise's roots-gritty and grounded, with real characters, dirt and grime, condensation on windows, old, creaky spaceships, cluttered interiors, cloudy skies, relentless rain, and bleak, unforgiving futures. It's raw and visceral, more so than Alien, more thrilling and dynamic than Aliens, and more epic than Alien 3.The meticulous attention to detail is striking, especially in the ship interiors and the retro computer systems that nostalgically transport you back to the 80s, mercifully steering clear of the overly slick visuals that marred recent entries in the series. You feel the cold, the sweat, the metal, the acid, the fumes, and those agonizing silences that make the tension unbearable.And as if that weren't enough, Uruguayan director Fede Alvarez proves himself a sadistic, violent, mad genius. An obsessive perfectionist, he's crafted a two-hour anxiety-inducing nightmare that will leave you squirming in your seat. Even the familiar alien life cycle, which we all know too well, is rendered more vivid, cruel, twisted, and almost unbearable to watch. At times, it feels like you're in hell itself.If you're faint-hearted, this film will test your limits; if you're not, it might just push you over the edge.Would I watch this film a thousand times like the originals? Probably not. Would I rewatch it at home? Definitely not. Alien Romulus is an experience that demands to be seen in a theater, where it can fully envelop you. The sounds, effects, and music don't just support the story-they are the story, making this a cinematic experience that lives and dies on the big screen.",2024-08-27

We've seen it all, many times, many variations of it all, it's very hard to be surprised or have our imagination excited these days.It's a good movie, they did all they could. But there's just nothing new here. Just a rehash of same old stuff we've seen before. So it doesn't have that ""hold your breath"" feel anymore.Somehow the 80s inspired environment feels far more real and believable than any modern CGI ""realistic stuff"". I had no problem believing those old CRT computers belonged in the space age. I appreciated that part.But there was not quite enough grit to the movie. Initially the movie had it but kind of lost it later on.Overall, the action, the throwbacks to the Alien Isolation game (which I'm playing right now, for the 10th time) are appreciated. The action, the countdown is all good 80s stuff. But all it does is make me feel extremely nostalgic for the times when movies elicited a sense of wonder rather than were just consumed.

And is the AVP movies better than this ? Yeah, I don't think so.Alien Romulus entertained me with its exciting scenes.

If you're a fan of ALIEN and ALIENS, and have an IQ above double digits, you will be sorely disappointed in this farce that gleefully fleeces the moviegoer of both their time and their fleetingly valuable money. The special effects are a mish mash of well done practical and cgi to abysmally obvious rc props and dated computer facial rendering. The film ignores prior movie canon in terms of technology, as well as glosses over the unknown portion of the xenomorph lifecycle with ""looky there, it just went from the size of a cucumber to bigger than a man without eating anything! Magic!""
The film literally recycles moments from almost every other film in the series without having the slightest spark of real creativity or adding anything truly interesting, compelling or unique to mark it as being something other than bad fan-fiction.For a thorough assessment, watch this-

456,paulclaassen,"Been there, done that, seen that...",6,"I must be honest, after seeing the trailer to 'Alien: Romulus' I wasn't really interested in watching it. 'Been there, done that', I thought. I mean, with 'Alien: Romulus' being the seventh film in this long-running franchise, how fresh and original could it possibly be?Cailee Spaeny stars as Rain in a very similar role to Ripley, portrayed by Sigourney Weaver. Her adopted 'brother' is an android called Andy. Rain is persuaded by her ex-boyfriend Tyler to join him and a small group of friends to break into a decommissioned ship to steal equipment. The only reason they want Rain to join them, is so Andy can accompany them in order to gain access to the ship.The 'ship' turns out to be a space station, which will crash into the planetary rings within 36 hours, thus creating a countdown to elevate the suspense. The space station is divided into Romulus and Remus sections, so most of the film is set in Romulus, as the title indicates.Off course, things soon go very wrong for the youngsters when the creatures appear. What follows, is more of the same alien mayhem we've seen before, and Rain rises to the occasion as protagonist - in pretty much the same manner Ripley did.There isn't really anything here we haven't seen before. Rain is the new Ripley (but Sigourney Weaver was much better), Navarro is a similar character to Private Vasquez from 'Aliens', Tyler is similar to Corporal Hicks from 'Aliens', just not as likeable or memorable, and I knew the android Rook looked awfully familiar (think Ash from 'Alien'). I guess Andy can be compared with Bishop from 'Aliens', and the scene with Kay being found alive was very similar to what happened to Newt in 'Aliens.The visual and practical effects remained good throughout all the films in the franchise, and 'Alien: Romulus' is no exception. Despite all the similarities to the previous films, I did find it entertaining and thought it was the best in the franchise after 'Alien', 'Aliens', and 'Prometheus'... Hmmm, ok, let's rather just say it was better than 'Alien 3', 'Alien Resurrection' and 'Alien: Covenant'... Then again, 'Alien Resurrection' felt more original. Oh, hell, let's just say we've seen it all before. I think I'll stick with 'Alien' and 'Aliens' - the only EXCELLENT movies in the franchise.The ending leaves the door wide open for (yet another) sequel, and no doubt Cailee Spaeny will reprise her role as Rain for a few more films before she, too, gets tired of it.",2024-10-28

I remember watching the trailer and it showing a movie that looks pretty thrilling. Thus, I decided to give it a watch. Before arriving at the theater I watched the original Alien, which was very good and made me more exited for this one. Having only seen that one, Romulus does a great job with its exposition and explaining what and why stuff is happening. The movie is played out very nicely with a few iffy moments, but the jaw dropping ending makes up for it and I think new and returning fans can find enjoyment in this film.

458,ardenderi,"#1 Alien movie by visual and ""game production"" design, with 3 major problems",7,"I give negatives first. 3 major problems1) end fatigue
This movie suffers from ending fatigue, meaning it has too many ending climaxes and twists in too short of a time. It is different from slow ending fatigue like Return of the King. This might be due to them cutting the movie significantly shorter.2) Borrowed video game trope: rammification of ""difficulty"" or ""complexity""
This movie tries to ramp up the intensity in.exponential rate. Unfortunately this doesn't work that well and it mostly happens at the ending. This problem is then overlaid with the ending fatigue problem meaning these problems enhance each other.3) Genre related ""tropes""
This is in short is all the bad character writing, ""helpless npc syndrome"" is common as is overall horror elements you have seen too few many times.Few smaller problems I consider are loudness, some "" movie problem"" solutions aka mediocre resolution writing and overall script cohesion problems.What I like then? Good audio design, amazing visual prdoction design (this includes what I call game design or you could call it level design"".

Set in the times of Alien and with a replicated ending, with the environment and the fighting of Aliens, hollow and unnecessary like Aliens 3, with the alien/human hybrid in Alien resurrection and all of this without Michael Fassbender. In fact, the prequels were entirely ignored.Natural fans will be wondering if they should feel fascinated or bored by the same old song without a tune.Newcomers to the franchise will not care much about the general aesthetics, due to the early eighties' sci -fi revival.It looks as if Mr Fede Álvarez just made a film to enjoy himself and with everything that he wanted to watch. Don't get me wrong, it's going to be in my ""list of movies to have in my bunker in the event of an apocalypse"", but could I have survived without it? Certainly yes.

As someone who has eagerly awaited this installment, I was not disappointed. The movie clearly boasts a high budget, and it shows in every frame, delivering a thrilling and visually stunning experience that fans of the series will appreciate.Alien: Romulus feels like a heartfelt tribute to the original trilogy-Alien, Aliens, and Alien 3. The visuals, in particular, seem to draw inspiration from these classics, creating an atmosphere that's both nostalgic and fresh. The film is undoubtedly aimed at long-time fans, with subtle nods and references that are sure to please. It's clear that the filmmakers are trying to breathe new life into the franchise, and for the most part, they succeed.Without giving too much away, there's a twist involving a synthetic that adds an intriguing layer to the story, keeping viewers on their toes. The film's narrative, while not groundbreaking, is solid and engaging, making it a worthy addition to the series.Personally, I'm more invested in the continuation of Ridley Scott's exploration of the Engineers and the origins of the Xenomorphs. While Alien: Romulus doesn't delve into these mysteries, it leaves me hopeful that one day we'll get answers to these lingering questions.In summary, Alien: Romulus is a successful homage to the original films, offering fans amazing visuals and a decent story that honors the legacy of the franchise.

463,My2centsDave,"Great, if you haven't seen the original two films.",3,"There are many good reviews for this movie, I assume this is due to so many younger folks not having seen the first two films. Alien Romulus is a poor attempt at a sequel, that borrows heavily from both Prometheus, as well as Alien, with lackluster results. While the set pieces and effects are good, the story and acting (by a cast made up completely of unknown, and very young actors) never quite matches the level of an adolescent TV show. The first hour of the film is all a set-up for the ending, and there's little to keep the viewer interested. While the final act does have a nice little twist, it's barely worth sitting through the almost 90 minute disappointment that is majority of the film, (at least from the point of view of someone who's seen the first two Alien films.) I think the the biggest difference between this film, and the originals, is the actors that were chosen, and a complete lack of suspense or edge-of-your-seat action, which were plentiful in each of the first two films. (one exception, is the well-done ""zero-G"" battle scene). The characters in the original were likeable, sometimes funny, and had personality... We cared about them, and each was unique . In Romulus, the android is the only character that we care about, and that's a sad statement.",2024-08-24

The overacting Gen Z actors make it hard to take the story seriously, and while it attempts to build tension, it's not that scary in the end. There are some nostalgic moments for fans of the franchise, but overall, it doesn't live up to its predecessors.

Then after fifty or so minutes he unleashes the horror, there are half a dozen really great set pieces and drama played out really well by the leads in the last half the movie, there is a fantastic scene when a certain character doesn't open a door for instance.The sets, practical effects spaceship CGI, sound and photography would be flawless apart there are a certain characters head rendered by CGI in a very distracting manor, comparable to Henry's face in the justice league.The film is literally like a rock band playing all their number one hits to a sold out stadium playing to the crowd what they want to see and hear, hence why there is everything you would want in a alien movie here, Easter eggs and overkill on the fan service.Fede Alvarez went down the list strong female lead tick, android tick,
alien tick aliens tick, acid blood tick tick etc.Be warned though, as i thoroughly enjoyed this film for what it is a b-grade sc-fi horror in space. There are considerable plot holes and strange choices Fede Alvarez makes in the last ten fifteen minutes.But the biggest problem this film has is it will always be compared to two of the greatest sc-fi horror movies of all time Alien and Aliens.

There are some real highs here, most notably the final act- that was a truly inspired conclusion. David Jonsson gives a fantastic performance as a fascinating android character.For much of its run, Romulus uses the same old tropes and highlights we've come to expect from the franchise. At many points this is effective. Where Alvarez leans into the same dialogue, the film runs into problems; these moments feel gimmicky and forced. I felt the Xenomorphs were a little too easy of an adversary, and some of their behavior just didn't line up here. Something about a Xenomorph getting ridden down an elevator shaft rubs me the wrong way.All in all, a solid addition to the franchise worthy of your time. I wish I had been able to see this in theaters, but with the hurricane bearing down a theater was out of the question tonight. After Alvarez's work with Evil Dead I had low expectations for this and can safely say they were surpassed.3*: Flawed but entertaining.",2024-09-26
467,juraj-jerkovic,starts not so great but becomes better,8,"OK, maybe an 8 is too much, but its definitely not below 7 altogether. If we look at it in three parts, the first is not good, the second is OK and the third is good. In the first part what I didnt like is that we dont get much to understand feel the setting. The characters we get to know are teenagers, or early twenties, who want to get to some planet and who somehow know how to operate spacecraft. They want to get hold of an abandoned large ship-space station which is orbiting around the planet they are on. We dont know why the ship is there, why is it abandoned, how come there is no one to claim it etc. The teenagers fly to it and that is the first part that is pretty bad and I thought I was in for a bad time altogether. Hollow story, hollow characters, blah. But it gets better later and becomes a true action horror SF that doesnt bore you with needless prolonged action scenes. Although it consists of a lot we have seen in previous Alien films, some of it very deliberate including literal quotes, it also has some new things. So ultimately I would say go and see it.",2024-08-25
468,nscoby93,Better than anticipated,6,"Let me establish real quick. I am not the biggest fan of the Alien franchise never have and probably never will. I could take it or leave it. Nonetheless, I respect the legacy of this widely adored franchise.With that being said Alien: Romulus was far better than I expected.What this film immediately gets right is its atmosphere and tone. Fantastic cinematography (which is elevated to great heights on the IMAX screen), great VFX, great sound design, and a musical score that sounded Alien in the best of ways. Also, they pay tremendous homage to the original Alien through its musical score and visuals.However, Romulus is not without its faults. I did not care for its cast of characters. Rain (Cailee Spaeny) and Andy (David Johnsson) were the only two characters I cared for. Both Cailee and David gave great performances. Everyone else was just throw away. Additionally, the first act was sort of dull. Sure, it offered great atmospheric build-up and world-building but offered little regarding character or story setup.Fortunately, the film does find sure-footing in the second and third acts, and that is where most of my enjoyment came from.Finally, this film offered me something I did not expect, which was a deeper story in the ways of the Xenomorph, face huggers, and Weyland Corp. It answered some questions that I always had. Perhaps these things had been explained in other Alien sequels but I haven't seen them in so long that I don't remember. So you'll have to forgive my ""Alien"" canon ignorance.Unfortunately, with a majority of the characters being stale and a first act that left much to be desired, this film just falls short of great, and on my scale, in my opinion, how you start is just as important as how you finish.Regardless I did enjoy myself and would encourage anyone going to see Alien: Romulus this opening weekend to watch it on the biggest screen possible.IMDb: 7/10
Letterboxd: 3/5Watched in IMAX Theater.",2024-08-16
469,ppbcgqjz,A solid filler for the Alien franchise!,8,"Wonderful cinematography and film score. I felt strapped in throughout the whole movie. A great mashup of Alien, Aliens and Prometheus, I feel it connected well to the lore. The third act was disturbing and felt like real horror to close things off.Only thing I would have liked to see was more character development and fix the CGI with Rook. Hopefully an extended edition comes out??Don't listen to the haters, the actors aren't kids they're in their mid 20s, since when do you need older characters to make a movie better? And yes it will be divisive with those who don't like Prometheus, but I feel those fans complain either way. Same fans that wanted more alien in alien covenant after Prometheus and then cracked it when they got that.It's a filler film that nails the sci-fi horror elements we were looking for and the Xenomorphs look awesome, was very happy Fede chose to use more practical effects, this needs to happen more!",2024-08-25
470,mrod-96528,Quite the love letter,9,"So to be completely transparent, this was my most anticaped movie of the year. The original Alien is one of my favorite films of all time and I had high hopes for this especially after Covenant because I think since the first movies release, this franchise stopped being scary. Scott's new entries into the franchise, while intensely intriguing and at times very body horroresque like its predecessor, were never scary. And after watching each entry this year in preparation for Romulus I can proudly say that I do have love for every single entry in this franchise. Although I didn't watch the AVPs for this prep I do still have love for those as well but more so than Freddy vs Jason those movies feel very much their own entity outside of both Predator and Alien films so I didn't feel the need to watch them before Romulus.I also wanted to go in completely blind before this and when that first teaser was released I thoroughly fell in love with Fede Alvarez all over again. It's a minute of overwhelming TEASING, as any good teaser trailer SHOULD be. Take notes studios because that's how you wet appetites and get assess into seats in my opinion. I didn't need to see a single trailer afterwards because my ticket was bought by that minute long video. Every time a new trailer played I closed my eyes in order to preserve that fresh view I so badly crave. Suffice it to say it worked because a day removed from release day and I'm on cloud 9 as a die hard Alien fan.Not only does it feel like an Alien film but the passion and love for the franchise practically oozes out of every scene. From the set designs of the ships to the interface of the technology to the creatures themselves, it all feels done by someone who loves the previous films. As soon as the opening starts and you see the system boot up in the empty ship out in the darkness of space I was taken back to 1979. Yes this movie was clearly made in the 2020s but the insides of this very much feels of that 70s film.Even down to the characters because we spend a large amount of time with them before even seeing any semblance of a facehugger or a Xenomorph. That's the other aspect of this that I felt has been taken from that Evil Dead remake but absolutely perfected in my opinion. In that remake people make dumb decisions for no reason but then you also have characters who you buy into because their motivation is excellently told throughout the film. In this film the first half directly references and impacts every decision that happens afterwards so even if I was upset over something someone does I can UNDERSTAND why they did it. To that point I'd love to call out the actors that played Andy and Rain because boy did they provide the emotional string for this story. I also love that throughout each film in this franchise we explore the depths of the AI experience in different avenues each time. The highs and lows that these two go through is as much a rollercoaster as the rest of the film and I was bought in for every single minute. The other characters are great as well but the focus is clearly rain and Andy. I felt exactly what I needed to feel with every single one of them but I will say that the bald girl was the only one that felt like canon fodder.Now for the effects and creature design I was completely blown away. Once again, nothing beats practical effects man. We're shown this time and time and time again but yet we still get so many green screen and CGI fests. To be more positive I think it's because of that that films like this shine through since it's not seen so often in other movies. The facehugger and Xenomorph are back in full glory with what I would imagine a costume, robotic puppets and full on constructed models because it was so hard for me to tell the CG polishing sometimes especially with the Xenomorph. Every single set piece having to deal with our big bads just FEELS like the character are truly in peril reacting to something that's actually there. The facehugger specifically bring back that creepiness that gave me goosebumps every time they crawled around and zoomed across the floor. The Xenomorph, my god, is a thing of absolute beauty. The first it does some stalking it sounds GIGANTIC. There's also many instances of that classic chain sequence from the first one. You're constantly scanning the environment to find it but many times in my experience I was too late to catch it before it whipped out in fury. Just a perfect chefs kiss man. Sorry to nerd out but it's just such a relief to see this done with such elegance.This also adds to my issue with Aliens because after rewatching a childhood favorite of mine I realized how different I view it now in hindsight. Perhaps at first glance when that movie came out it was like, ""you thought one was bad? Try twenty!"" And I just couldn't feel the terror anymore while watching it. The Xenomorphs felt expendable and by extent less threatening. Sure the queen is an absolute piece of cinema but the drones just feel lesser than; almost like well there's 50 of us now so we don't have to try so hard anymore. In Romulus however the Xenomorph feels like an absolute unit again just like the original. It took me back to the time I played Alien Isolation, never finished it because life is too short for that amount of stress, but those vibes are there the entire runtime. There are just set pieces here that had my wife and I cringing in our seats afraid to see what would happen next or in absolute anxiety for someone to avoid the acid or sneak past one of these facehuggers.The sound design is also incredible. We watched this in IMAX and boy were my ears ringing when you hear a ships exhaust. Not just the loud roaring of an engine but also the deathly silence of space as well. You go from an intense score with loud roaring or banging to absolute NOTHINGNESS in .5 seconds and it just intensifies the space setting. You also get the classic Xenomorph hiss which was just horrid music to my ears.I think on the level of the creature design where this movie also excels is its respect to the franchise as a whole. I love Halloween but I will admit that the 2018 'Halloween awakens' does harp on your nostalgia of the original and past entries a little too much at times and it's hard to take seriously when you're blatantly wiping the slate clean from movies we've watched over the years. Alien Romulus does a lot of homages to technical future entries, timeline wise, but also treats them with respect in a way of showing you, 'yeah we love this one too.' Not only that but it also references the original AND prequels in a way I didn't expect. This movie acknowledges its continuity and respects your knowledge of it, if you're privy to it and even more so if you enjoy those movies. In my opinion it does it in an even better way than Chucky has as of late because while respecting what came before they're also not afraid to give some new things as well. I won't relay what those new things are for spoilers sake but I was pleasantly surprised and pleased with the new things we see here.I've gushed long enough over this movie. I'm actually hoping to watch it again in 4DX just for the spaceship scenes but I'll gladly watch it again in normal formats. I didn't think I would love every entry on my journey to Romulus but I'm pleasantly surprised to have found love in the ones that have been deemed stains on the legacy. Now though after watching Romulus I definitely feel like I've garnered much more love for those films because of this one's reverence for what came before. I walked out of this movie just so happy to have been creeped AND grossed out again like when I first watched the 1979 original, even unnerved at one point. I won't go crazy with recency bias saying this one is better but I will say that I think I could rewatch this much easier than I'd be able to with the original. However, I think that this makes a solid double feature with the original given they both share the same horrific tones. If you also love Aliens then this definitely creates a pretty excellent trilogy but like I said before, Romulus makes it a point to fit perfectly within the entire continuity not just the classics. That to me puts it above a lot of new age sequels that have came out and lands it high on my 'best of' list, whether it be the franchise or the year 2024.",2024-08-19
471,tadejbirsa-665-126146,"Not a win, not a loose...its a tie",7,"Here it is, one of the most hyped movies of the year. And here it is, the question we re always asking when a sequel to a worldwide cult movie saga comes out? Is it good, is it bad, what does it add to the series.... Those are all questions we all had but where are the answers. Surely not here in this timid movie that plays it safe, too safe. While the fun is always there and time flies like a spaceship this is pretty much it. Fede Alvarez doesnt risk anything and designs this movie as a greatest hits of everything you have already seen. Which might be good, might be bad, might be boring, might be fun, i guess its up to you. Its the way Disney is redisigning its acquired franchaises. Prometheus with all its stupid faults tried to fly in uncharted territory and the audience pretty much hated it so i guess this being the exact contrary makes sense.So what do you have at the end of ride?

Instead of being a memorable and unique character, it comes across as a generic and uninspired alien trope that we've seen countless times before. The script is predictable and lacks depth, and the characters are poorly developed and hard to empathize with.

474,marcintn,Great movie but too many callbacks.,8,"I thought this was a great film. It has action, atmosphere, and a solid cast. The one thing I found to be detracting from the story was the insane amount of forced callbacks peppered throughout the movie. So apparently every alien encounter will inspire someone to randomly say, ""Get away from her you bi""*h!"" Your female protagonist will also at some point always be scantily clad, sweaty, and breathless, while scrambling to get into a space suit. Also every Hyperdyne Synthetic from that era will tell out heroes, ""You have my sympathies."" when informing them of their chances.All these things felt forced and a little embarrassing and cringe worthy.Now beyond that I loved the appearance of the Pulse Rifles and wish they had been used more often.This is probably the best sequel since Aliens hands down.

The story of a look into a Weyland colony was cool but basically just filler to get to the real plot (face hugger becomes alien hunt everyone). Andy was the only interesting character, all the rest felt forced (like the douchebag cousin). At times the script was cringeworthy. It really was frustrating seeing them set up a potentially very cool story about struggling Weyland colonists instead to be like the story version of ticking the T&Cs.In ways of horror it was weak. There was nothing new, it played out too fast to be suspense building, you care little for one dimensional characters and deus ex machinas are overused. Feels like 0 consequences.Visually stunning.

Especially after the first act, THIS is what I want an Alien movie to be like. Plus, it added good new twists and unique ideas that made it stand out (like the cool acid scene with the gravity being shut on and off)! That's the genius of this franchise and of the design of this creature, you can do so much with Xenomoprhs and I'm so glad that we got a better film because I would've been frustrated if we ended the whole thing with Covenant which was a disappointment. Plus, the Xenomorphs actually look a lot better since they're practical and not CGI! Sure this movie is a bit similar in some ways to previous Alien movies in the franchise with some moments and familiar callbacks, but it's good as its own movie and got REAL scary within the last 15 minutes. Cailee Spaeny did well in the film (however is oddly similar looking to Jennifer Lawrence which is a side point).

Unfortunately the films squanders a lot of this good will on tiresome fan service.Alien is not Star Trek, it does not have a huge fanbase of nerds with an encylopedic knowledge of every film/episode in the franchise. The fan base is largely casual movie-goers who do not care what happened in other Alien films, which makes the decision to paraphrase iconic lines from previous films, and recycle plot points all the more confusing.

The young actors were well directed, which helped a lot. They took a slightly different approach to the android and I think it was a smart choice.

480,madmaxwell93,Good but not great,7,"Disclaimer: This review is based on my memory of seeing the movie in theaters.Alien Romulus (2024) is a sci-fi horror flick that acts as a stand-alone sequel to the original Alien (1979) and is set before the events of the second film Aliens (1986).It follows our protagonist Rain Carradine (Cailee Spaeny), an orphan girl who lives and works with her adoptive cyborg brother Andy (David Jonsson) at the space colony called Jackson's Star. Rain's contract with the colony gets extended against her will, leaving her no choice but to join her ex-boyfriend Tyler (Archie Renaux) and his friends and relatives to travel to an abandoned spacecraft to retrieve cryo chambers in the hopes to escape to the planet Yvaga. However, there's a threatening alien life form that made its way aboard the ship, terrorizing the crew and is killing the members one by one, while the remaining members are fighting to survive and to kill the Alien. That's about the gist of the plot really.I saw this movie in theaters this past Sunday and I thought it was a decent movie. It's pretty well directed and well-acted and has some pretty intense scares and action scenes. However, I don't think it was that great to deserve its certified fresh score on Rotten Tomatoes. I felt it dragged a bit, especially during the first half. The movie mostly felt like a carbon remake of the first Alien movie. The characters were pretty forgettable. I couldn't even remember any of the characters' names except for maybe Andy, probably because he was the most interesting character. He was kind of like a villain but also had redeeming qualities, so that was interesting. I thought the third act was awesome and I felt that was where the movie really found its footing. All in all, I think Alien Romulus (2024) was good but not great. I think it's inferior to the first two Alien movies, Alien and Aliens. I can't say the same about the rest of the series.Alien 3 (1992) was okay, but the beginning and ending were both a bit of a letdown. Alien Resurrection (1997) was pretty bad if I recall. I kind of liked Prometheus (2012) and Alien Covenant (2017), but it's been a while so I may have to rewatch those. Anyway, that's about all I have to say about Alien Romulus.I give Alien Romulus (2024) a solid 7/10.",2024-09-04

482,RussHog,Alien: The Force Awaken (Romulus One),6,"This movie feels like Star Wars: The Force Awakens was put into the Alien Franchise, and what came out was a little like Star Wars: Rogue One.Alien: Romulus it's not as much pure awfulness as The Force Awakens, yet nowhere near as close how classic the original Alien is, and still, somehow it is more flat and bland than Rogue One.Now, it's important to put all this in context. This is the SEVENTH Alien movie (if you minus the AvP films). And it's coming off of the deplorable Prometheus franchise - which took the characters in a bizarre new direction that made no sense whatsoever.So, basically...this is Alien (s) 7. And it's about what you might expect. It doesn't expand the mythology it just throws all the goodies at you as our heroes run around a ship trying to accomplish their mission and get out alive.There is cool stuff in this film - including the face-huggers are as creepy as ever. We get sinister android action, cool acid blood moments, and all kinds of bad-bugs who need to be blasted out into space. There are a few gross moments and a final alien that is just plain old weird.There is also the need to repeat old lines and props and set pieces from previous films - which is stupid but it's not like the film was making fun of any of that stuff or trying to one up it - just playing homage.Aliens: Romulus is - I guess - like a Disney theme park ride. You buckle up and go on a roller coaster through the Alien universe. You see some familiar faces, have a lot of creatures jump out at you, there are a few scares, some ok action, and nothing is as good as the original but when it's over you had a pretty good time.One thing that might help this franchise going forward if they continue in this part of the Alien storyline, is to bring in Michael Fassbender's android character from the previous two films - it might help tie together some lose ends and I did think his presence would have helped this film a lot.Anyhow - my one rule with these kinds of films is just use the best of what works in the franchise and try to get the most out of it...don't redo stuff or try to change things and make it all suck. And Aliens: Romulus at least tries to take the best of the Aliens movies and make something watchable out of it.",2024-08-18

It didn't just have the aliens as the things to be afriad of but also got incredibly creative with other horric things like they did in Prometheus.I don't think it's a good as promethus which had a mastermind plot and backstory but this touched on it a lot and used many of the same elements.Action packed, decent story line, very fun and very scary movie. It's kind of like Rogue one - an amazing side project movie in the star wars universe, which still ties into the same story line (kind of) with it's own amazing plot.Not as amazing as the Ridley Scott ones, but a great admirable addition which is worthy of a watch if you're a fan of the franchise.",2024-08-25

It was one of those films that make up a pantheon of the genre. Certainly not beaten for effect, story telling, having a female lead role and shock, but often matched, although with perhaps the exception of Aliens.So whilst I was keen to see the latest edition in the franchise I wasn't really expecting that much, even though everyone seems to be raving about it. They are raving about it because it's up there with Alien and Aliens.From the moment the computers made exactly the same noise as the original ones, to the way the music reflects the emptiness of space, to the story being about you and me, Joe and Jo average, and how we're going to get it!There are of course moments where you'll jump, but it would be hard to match the original John Hurt moment.....no spoiler here, (of course there's the stomach churning bursting out), but there is a very tense moment where you will be riveted to your seat.

487,GabrielSymes,Solid,7,"Watching this was a little like watching the first Alien. There are a lot of similarities in terms of style, setting, atmosphere and so on. If you enjoyed Alien you will probably enjoy this.Downsides, and more comparisons with the original, the cast was quite young. Which is fine, and they turned in solid performances, but we didn't get the same level of gravitas the original Alien cast emanated. None come close to Sigourney Weaver, Tom Skerritt, John Hurt, Harry Dean Stanton and Ian Holm, sadly.The Alien franchise has a fairly standard format. Giger's charismatic xenomorphs, created from endoparasitoid larvae laid by face-hugging crab-like creatures. The xenomorphs kill a bunch of people, but usually leave a one or two alive to aid their escape from the impending doom of the moment. And so it is with Alien: Romulus. As a film, it adds little to Alien lore, which is kind of a shame.This is a solid and watchable 7/10, maybe edging to an 8/10.",2024-08-20
488,josephbrewster-88279,Somewhere in the Alien timeline...,8,"Did you love Alien? Go ahead and buy the ticket. It's worth seeing in theaters. Not familiar with the franchise? It's ok, you will be able to keep up with 80% of the film, while wondering about the significance of the other 20%.Recapturing the claustrophobic dread that defined the original *Alien* while expanding the franchise's rich lore, Romulus is sure to please the long time fans in many regards, while retaining enough of the Prometheus-esque philosophical side notes to keep the rumor mills milling. The film, directed with meticulous care, serves as both a reverent homage and a (mostly) original continuation of the saga, nestling itself quietly within the existing timeline in ways the casual fan might not immediately recognize. The narrative, while familiar in its primal terror, introduces fresh horrors that feel both inevitable and fresh, for the most part.The acting is uniformly good, with the cast delivering performances that ground the cosmic horror in a grim, relatable reality. I wasn't a fan of the anti-synth gangbanger character, but I suppose a stereotypical character is excusable. There are some Deja Vu moments for sure, with this cast making mistakes you've seen before in this franchise, but the derivations are mild enough to also be excusable, I thought.The film's use of body horror is both a nod to the franchise's roots and a continuation of its exploration of the grotesque artistry of H. R. Giger. The unmistakable fusion of macabre, sexual imagery and alien biology has never, I think, been pushed harder than in Romulus. Here, the body becomes not just a vessel for terror (AKA chest bursting) but a canvas of unsettling insinuations and unholy film magic. I was uncomfortable at several points, in ways I haven't felt in other Alien movies, albeit the themes weren't entirely new.Overall, Romulus is a worthy addition to the Alien canon, a film that honors its predecessors while carving out its own identity. It thrives on its atmosphere-a brooding, oppressive vibe that echoes the best of the franchise-while at times retreading familiar ground when I wished it had gone outside the box, but that's just me. It may not redefine the genre, but it certainly reaffirms why this universe continues to captivate and terrify in equal measure, and it really doubles down on the uncanny, unnerving and yet beautifully dark imagery of Giger.",2024-08-21
489,danchilton-71955,Space (and Body) Invaders,7,"With Alien: Romulus, Fede Alvarez becomes the latest director to try and recreate the magic of Alien and/or Aliens. Unsurprisingly he doesn't get close to those two masterpieces but he does serve an atmospheric slice of sci fi horror that may well scratch an itch for those unimpressed with the heavy handed musings of Prometheus and Alien: Covenant.Set in the time period between Alien and Aliens, the story of Romulus is a back to basics haunted house but in space tale about a group of young miners attempting to escape corporate servitude by breaking into a derelict space station and liberating enough fuel to keep them in stasis while they reach another developed planet. Turns out the station is more decimated then decommissioned and they soon find themselves on the bottom of the local food chain.The break in may be a group effort but it's clear from the off that the main focus of the story is Cailee Spaeny's Rain and her ""brother"" Andy, a salvaged synthetic human played by David Jonsson. Spaeny is an excellent lead, likeable and believable as a modern Ripley who grows in stature to deal with her increasingly grim situation. Jonsson might be even better, following up last years Rye Lane with another star making turn as he plays two different versions of Andy across the runtime. You are pretty much on board with the whole team from the get go (except the one obligatory douchebag) as their circumstances are so dire it feels like this is there only realistic shot at having a life.Romulus is a slow burn, taking plenty of time to get to the alien action. Building tension is admirable but without the mystery that carried the early parts of the original the set up feels a little laboured. That said, when things kick off, they kick off. Alvarez uses all the skills he learned making The Evil Dead and Don't Breathe to set up insanely tense moments and there are some gnarly kills. For the most part there is a real focus on practical effects and this may be the best a Xenomorph has ever looked. The design really invokes the sexual violation iconography of the original, if something isn't trying to get inside people it's opening up a like a mutant vagina. The impregnation theme culminates in a final showdown that is simultaneously terrifying and goofy and is likely to prove divisive amongst series fans.The film works best when it is being a stripped down genre movie so the constant desire to scream ""this is an Alien film"" is actually it's biggest flaw. Call backs to the Nostromo and Colonial Marine pulse rifles are all well and good but when the plot starts to be influenced by the prequels it's a little less welcome. There is also an attempt to drop a classic line that will make most people cringe in their seat.Where Ridley Scott's last two efforts in this universe were packed with ambition but muddled in execution, Romulus is all execution and very little ambition. It's essentially a remix of what's gone before coated in slick new paint and delivered by someone who knows their way around a horror film. That's good enough for an entertaining two hours.7 decisions that are best for the company out of 10.Note: Ian Holm plays a fairly major part in this movie. How can he do that if he died four years ago? By using AI to recreate his face and voice a la Peter Cushing in Rogue One a few years ago. I personally detest this and was tempted to score the film a 1 out of 10 as a result. In the end, it seems his family are happy about it and I'm not sure how egregious everyone else finds it so I decided not to factor it into the review.",2024-08-30
490,sashareed,The Ultimate in Alien Terror,10,"Tl;dr it's unsettling, it has some wholesome little homages to the movies before it, the third act actually terrified me, and it made me feel the way the original didI first saw Alien as a teenager. What I thought would be a casual family movie night turned into a pivotal moment in forming what I look for and love in movies: beautiful shots, haunting music, and shocking, unseen horrors.I loved Aliens, Prometheus, and Alien: Covenant. Each had something special about them, and are of course a matter of taste, but also each had those three elements; the shots, the music, and something that surprised me.I went into this movie with fairly high expectations, knowing that they were utilizing practical effects, knowing that I have loved the more recent installments in the Alien franchise. The movie starts somewhat slow with an almost Blade Runner-esque tone. As the second act begins, the pace picks up and that familiar feeling that we were in an Alien movie began. There were several moments in this movie that I thought ""wow, this really reminds me of the original,"" between the lighting, angles, and music selection, but of course it would; it's a sequel.The third act brought something special that no other Alien sequel had for me: it made me feel the same way I did while watching the original all those years ago. I was surprised. I was scared. I was enthralled.The challenge of creating a new movie in such a well-established franchise is figuring out how to turn up the heat, trying to find a way to surprise an audience that is expecting the unexpected. I truly feel the creators of this movie did just that. Art is always a matter of taste, and so if your tastes include more modern horror films, creepy monsters, and a few tacky homages to previous films to bring a bit of levity to an otherwise-morbid film, this just might be the movie for you!",2024-08-25

A throwback to the previous instalments and definitely entertaining. The film not falling short of shadows and shocks, makes for spills and horrific chase scenes.

492,frankanthonymaggiore,"At long last, a film that truly succeeds Aliens (1986)",10,"With all due respect to David Fincher's 'Alien 3', which is imo very misunderstood, and Ridley Scott's 'Prometheus'.... Fede Alvarez accomplished what 3 other directors could not. He finally gave viewing audiences the worthy 3rd installation to the franchise which has alluded fans for three decades.Alien Romulus is the perfect synthesis of everything that worked in the original two films and it manages to move the story of Weyland Industries, and their quest to exploit Xenomorph biology, forward.The film is a perfect companion piece to the original two films and squeezes in nicely between both, whilst also incorporating elements of Prometheus as well.Additionally the film features incredibly nuanced performances from both Cailee Spaeny and David Jonsson (who imo steals the show).This is everything a true fan of the franchise has longed for, an Alien film with all of the correct elements and story beats, but with all the benefits of today's visual effects and film making tools.See it in IMAX if you can. I will certainly be seeing it twice.Hands down the best film of 2024 thus far. Masterful execution and probably the most visually impressive sci-fi survival horror films ever made.",2024-08-19
493,xixmetatronxix,An Awfully Uninspired Genetic Monstrosity,3,"""Alien Romulus"" attempts to revive the franchise but serves up an uninspired genetic homunculus that fails to capture any of the originality, suspense, or terror of Ridley Scott's original movie.Romulus' inability to evoke awe, drama, or horror, its lacklustre characters, the execrable CGI, its fawning, pathetic attempts at homage, its meh world-building, and absolutely rotten 'genetic' expansion make for a horribly underwhelming addition to the increasingly disappointing Alien movie family.Do yourself a favour and ketchup with the original ""Alien"" movie or go play ""Alien Isolation"" in the dark.Alien movie franchise breakdown:The original ""Alien"" (1979) is a masterclass in suspense and atmospheric horror. Its claustrophobic setting aboard the Nostromo and the gradual revelation of the Xenomorph's terrifying nature created a tension that has rarely, if ever, been matched in the genre. Much of the film's success lies in its restraint and in H. R. Giger otherworldy creature and set designs, along with the way the movie builds dread, leaving much to the imagination and allowing the horror to unfold in a slow, creeping fashion.""Aliens"" (1986), directed by James Cameron, took the franchise in a new direction, blending action with horror in a way that felt both fresh and exhilarating. Cameron's film expanded the universe and the stakes, introducing a more militaristic and high-octane approach while still respecting the core horror elements. The blend of intense action and survival horror set a new benchmark for sequels, maintaining the suspense while delivering thrilling set pieces. But the rot had begun to set in now that ""Alien"" had become Blockbuster material.""Alien 3"" (1992), despite its mixed reception, continued to explore the dark and grim atmosphere of the series. Directed by David Fincher, it returned to the more isolated, confined setting, echoing the original's claustrophobic tension and offering a somber, introspective take on the Alien mythos. Its bleak, unforgiving tone and the focus on Ripley's struggle against the alien threat helped maintain a connection to the core themes of the franchise. Unfortunately Alien 3 is where the genetic muckery first reared it's ugly head and most of the movies that followed would fall foul of it.""Alien Resurrection"" (1997) continued the saga with a blend of dark humor and sci-fi intrigue, directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet. While its tone was markedly different from its predecessors, the film still offered a unique, if hokey, take on the Alien universe. And while the exploration of Ripley's cloning was initally intriguing the resulting new breed of Xenomorphs was horribly off putting.""Aliens vs. Predator"" (2004), while not a perfect film, managed to inject some fresh energy into the franchise by combining the worlds of the Xenomorphs and Predators in a way that was both thrilling and entertaining. It provided a different kind of spectacle while respecting the established lore and offering fans a chance to see these iconic creatures clash in a setting that felt both new and familiar.""Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem"" (2007), even the ridiculous AVPR manages to be more entertaining than Romulus. It's hommage à deux a mish mash of both ""Aliens"" and ""Predator"" that, while way off canon, still provides some decent thrills and a tolerable genetic monster combo.Prometheus (2012) and Alien Covenant (2017) continued the downward spiral into genetic meh-dom despite some fine moments and excellent cast.",2024-08-16

Great cinematography, especially the lighting techniques. Overall, I'm very glad they brought back the original horror element, aesthetics, and suspense. I'm definitely going to see it a second time, preferably on an IMAX screen. This movie was made for the oversized screen. I'd considered this Alien to be the 3rd best in the series.",2024-08-21
495,bowmanblue,"Not bad, for a 'midquel'",7,"Right off the bat, 'Alien Romulus' isn't as good as the two previous entries in the series, but probably alongside the third and forth one (we'll just ignore the 'vs Predator' and 'Prometheus' movies). 'Romulus' wears its reverence for its predecessors on its sleeve with its oppressive, industrial set design to the dim, flickering lighting. At least this goes a long way to make the film looks and feel like it was made alongside the original.The art direction and practical effects are pretty good and these 'plus points' go some way to obscure its narrative shortcomings. There's plenty of fan service and they do help to make up for just how bland most of the characters were (the only real stand-out is the android who's by far the most interesting of the - way too young - spaceship's crew). However, as the story goes on, moments that echo 'Alien' and 'Aliens' come frequently-too frequently. The film risks leaning so heavily on its predecessors that it struggles to carve out its own identity.At least it is watchable, delivering enough tension, gore, and xenomorphic mayhem to satisfy fans. Where the film falters most is in its plot. At first glance, the story seems serviceable, but the cracks start to show if you think too hard about its finer details. The lead actress will never come close to Sigourney Weaver's iconic portrayal of Ripley and general character motivations rely on leaps of logic that strain believability.Perhaps the worst part was the last fifteen minutes which are so drawn-out and redundant that they threaten to undo some of the goodwill the rest of the film earns. It's not a total disaster, but it feels more like an extended epilogue than a satisfying conclusion. Despite its flaws, 'Alien Romulus' is a worthy addition to the franchise for those willing to embrace it on its own terms. It may not match the brilliance of the original or its immediate sequel, but its nostalgic feel and overall tension make it an enjoyable, if imperfect, homage. Just don't go in expecting airtight storytelling, and you'll likely come out entertained.",2024-11-17
496,PerryAtTheMovies,More boring than I expected....,6,"6.2/10 (Recommend)Once again a film that I very much wanted to see, but has the unfortunately of calling back on references in order to make its film work. I've never watched the original ""Aliens"" film so I don't know if that hurt or bettered my chances of enjoying the film. My belief is that a sequel film is great if it can both be welcoming to newcomers, but also familiar for returners. That being said, I feel like ""Romulus"" falls a little short for newcomers.I was more or less entertained, but it takes far too long for the scares to happen. It didn't feel like there was very much tension until the film was nearing its end. All I thought for most of it was, ""when is it going to get good?"" The build-up is even slower so by the time the good stuff happens I was ready for the film to end.The acting is alright. The actors felt mostly convincing in the circumstances that they were in. Like any film there are characters that are enjoyable, and some that are definitely not. However, no one stands out as being above and beyond.While flashy sequences try and make the film more tense. Not getting to enjoy the creatures is a bit of a let down. I get certain shots are meant to increase anxiety and bring you into the action, but oftentimes it was blur that was so quick it didn't feel thrilling.Overall, I still enjoyed ""Romulus"" to an extent. If I were to watch it again it would definitely be a home movie to see. Maybe I'll even check out ""Aliens"" before watching this one again. The sound and music were above par for me, but everything else was a mediocre standard. While I recommend checking it out, I'd personally wait until streaming to see it if I could redo my choice again.That's it for now. Thanks for taking time to read my review. Happy watching and enjoy the show!",2024-08-21

The alien creature looks great and is as smart as ever.This movie is, at the very least, great in its own right. The action sequences are great and with a lot of new great touches to them(if compared to its predecesors).With younger than average actors this time around, I guess they are appealling to a youger audience, which in turn opens up a window for more sequels.Acting is good enough(especially the lead pair).This review is coming from a hard core fan of the series, ever since the first movie(1979).

Kaylee Spaney delivers a standout performance as the lead, carrying much of the film's emotional weight. David Johnson as Andy, the synthetic Android, adds an extra layer of intrigue and moral complexity. Although he doesn't quite match the depth of Michael Fassbender's portrayal in Prometheus and Covenant, his role remains compelling and essential to the narrative. Visuals and Technical Aspects: Visually, Alien Romulus is a feast for the eyes. The film boasts stunning cinematography, especially in its zero-gravity sequences and practical effects.

503,influxtwo,Packs the punch of the allure.,7,"Packs the punch of the allure. Where Alien 3 failed us, Alien: Romulus, plugs the leak in the airlock by wedging itself between the first & second film, bridging a new timeline between the classics.The film starts with the gorgeous vacuum of space, distilled in silence, a motif vividly told inbetween shots of blinking retro-futuristic monitors in a spaceship interior with a throwback set design.The characters are introduced as if we already know them. Bumbling through a familiar dystopian world where desires are eclipsed by the unforgiving agony of society.The main protagonist, Rain Carradine (Spaeny) has a calm, serene, and balanced nature that makes her a decent addition to the franchise to step in to it's new shoes.Other than the artificial characters- there are some non-human characters,- the remaining cast doesn't have much dialogue, simply then assessing the narrative of the impending hardships.While that was refreshing on one hand, it felt undercooked at times on another. Some characters don't have much character development and some feel saved for later, for gimmicky plot revelations.Again, still not a bad thing if you know what to look for in an Alien movie, some things are just served too simple, and I wondered watching if that is the case here.With that said, the ending has a great pulse to it. There are sequences that make this one stand out, and it lies in the capabilities of today's filmmaking. The effects, models, and sets are a saving grace.My one complaint is that there were not a lot of Xenomorphs featured. Many perished on screen, but it was not quite the amount of Xenomorphs I personally wanted to see. Had there been a bit more focus on the Xenomorphs, I feel it would have helped helm this sequel.Instead what we got was the now famous ending, which, due to the set design, music, effects, and a stunning performance by Spaeny, made this a fun tension-filled venture that benefits from the air-tight sound system & darkness of a theater experience. I enjoyed the end sequence because it took Prometheus lore and sequenced it in to the Alien hybrid kind of mythology. What results is more trick-or-treat candy for those like myself who largely enjoyed Alien: Resurrection, and most of the other sequels that threw some punches out of left field.What i like is that Retro-Futurism is mainstream in an Alien film again finally. The atmosphere was on par with a Jurassic Park movie, they intentionally went for the rubbery prosthetic jiggly-look that I could appreciate in a modern film.I enjoyed the mayhem I just wish it served a bit more. The writing could have used some better direction, the calamity of it all made it a suspenseful watch. But the plot holes were a little too glaring. It's definitely a ""just hold on for the ride and don't question anything too much"" kind of watching experience. All in all a leap in the right direction, that proves the Alien formula still lives in visceral terror.",2024-08-28
504,mford-55285,Brilliant addition but released 40+ too late,7,"This is a great film! But I really wish I hadn't seen any of the films after the original.If this Is the first alien film you've seen it'll be a 10/10 watch for you.The plot is certainly a good one and a fresher take on what has become a predictable storyline franchise.The nods to all other films in the series are cool and ties them all in to the story seamlessly.The imagination used to portray the creatures and atmosphere is also a strong plus.BUT......
The nods to other films, the amount of airtime the variety of aliens get, the crispness of cinematography and the use of a louder and more dramatic score, are what I feel hold back this film from being epic.To explain, alot of the horror, shocks, sheer thrill and suspense of the first came from the simplistic visuals and sounds. This allows your imagination to take over and build it's own horror factors in. Not seeing the alien or facehugger really at all was another big factor as to why the first film is so shocking.For romulus to fit in where it does in the time line I feel it has too much going on visually and it's a damn shame it's released now and not in the late 70s with its plot as I think it could have topped the first film as best in series.",2024-08-18

It feels like everyone is whining that it wasn't what they wanted or seem to have their own expectation/idea blah blah... heard this same crap with Star Wars.So, if you really got this film. It's an homage to the original franchise while giving nods to some of the other installments. There's a reason why Ridley Scott stayed involved despite it not being the final chapter to the Prometheus saga. People really need to stop comparing this to Covenant as well. They are VERY different in every way, except for the Xenomorph itself.Alien: Romulus gives a fresh take on the FEAR that was once apart of Alien. Like any other fan, I'd love to see what the conclusion of Prometheus was, but for now this is really amazing. I even went in thinking it probably would be boring or unoriginal. It is none of those things. Seems like people have forgotten the AvP films and Alien3 as well as the horrible Alien: Resurrection. All these negative reviews? Throw them back at the crap Fox churned out for so many years. Since Ridley returned to the franchise, we've gotten a mixed bag of goodies. This is the ONE people will remember as very different. The third chapter is pure nightmare fuel. That itself says ALOT for an Alien film.While it isn't perfect, it's definitely one of the best of the franchise. It stands on its own and delivers without being corny. It actually managed to bring that creepy uneasy feeling back. I don't want to spoil the film because I think everyone should go in blind. 8/10.

508,kluseba,Back to the Roots of Science-Fiction and Survival Horror,8,"Alien: Romulus is the ninth entry in the famous science-fiction franchise since its debut forty-five years ago. The new feature film might not be able to compete with the classics like Alien and Aliens but it's certainly better than the franchise's worst entries such as Alien 3 and Prometheus. At the end of the day, Alien: Romulus is situated right in the middle and its quality is best compared to instalments such as Alien Resurrection.This new movie essentially goes back to the franchise's roots. The first quarter of the movie introduces us to characters and settings. The remaining three quarters are an intense survival story on an abandoned spaceship. The story is serviceable and simple. A group of six young adults want to escape their colony as they are suffering from savage capitalism and brutal working conditions by boarding a derelict spacecraft. Once on board of the abandoned spacecraft, conflicts emerge between the six adults who realize that they aren't prepared to face their upcoming challenges that they had gravely underestimated. In addition to this, they soon learn that they aren't alone on this spacecraft and that several serious dangers await.This movie convinces on multiple levels. First and foremost, its simple plot feels refreshing and enhances the survival mood of this energetic film. Secondly, this movie has a gloomy atmosphere from start to finish. Thirdly, the movie's special effects aren't overused but employed highly efficiently nonetheless. Fourthly, the enemies the six youngsters encounter are most memorable as they are clever, scary and unpredictable. Fifthly, the settings blend in perfectly as the abandoned spacecraft turns out to be a most confusing mess of corridors, halls and laboratories.Few things deserve to be criticized in this film. In my opinion, lead actress Cailee Spaeny is miscast in this movie. Don't get me wrong, I have admired her in movies such as Civil War, The Craft: Legacy and Bad Times at the El Royale but she fails to convince in her role as resilient survivor and strong fighter against an army of enemies. Another element that deserves to be pointed out is the movie's ending that hints at a potential sequel. I prefer when a movie has a proper conclusion and I would also like to question whether a tenth entry in the franchise is necessary. Hollywood keeps rehashing ideas from the past time and again and I believe the time has come to explore new territory altogether.To keep it short, Alien: Romulus is a very good science-fiction film and a great survival horror movie. In the Alien franchise, it's situated right in the middle as it easily outclasses its worst entries but can't compete with its greatest feature films. This movie often reminds me of the excellent video game Alien: Isolation. If you haven't played this game yet, you should certainly do so as it has stood the test of time and manages to outclass this new movie.",2024-10-02
509,jussipekkaturunen,I gave 7 but it is a really good watch!,7,"Really good movie. I totally recommend to watch it in cinema. Then why 7? Because of the details. This movie had huge potential and it's really pity that it didn't cash out everything what it could had. I think action scenes aren't that particularly interesting. They are good but not as good as in Aliens. And they should be even better because the quality of the production is incredibly high. The movie sounds and looks excellent but action scenes as such doesn't just rise quite above the bar. The best thing about the movie is that it was really interesting to watch from the first scene to the end. I never had a boring moment. Maybe at the middle point the movie little bit of loses the pace but not that bad.I must give extra credit to the final action scene. There are some things that I totally didn't expect. Maybe even the best part of the movie. The creature design at the end is extremely well made. It's pity that they didn't take complete advantage of very disturbing and twisted creature design at the very end.I also think that the movie runs little bit of too short. Usually I find lees is more in movies better but here it's almost like there is 20 mins missing.Just a final note. When watching this movie, I understand what a master of movies James Cameron is.

511,spinoff75,Honors the franchise but...,7,"Well, its not Ridley's or Cameron's but it's watchable.A few ""buts"" though:1. The CGI of Rook (Ian Holm) is lame. Hollywood doesn't get it properly yet. It's almost 2025 and the skin and eyes of digital characters still looks so fake! How it's good Colin Farrell's The Penguin? Because they used prosthetics. Latex still beats computer in this area.2. Young adult cast (trying to look mature but they look like dumb teenagers) is not credible most of the times. You realize they lack of an acting career and method.3. ""Get away from her, you bitch!"". WHY USE THIS? This iconic quote belongs to Ripley and Sigourney Weaver only. It's not homage here. Just lazy dialog.",2024-10-20
512,batmanvsmoonknight,Back to the roots,8,"Alien: Romulus successfully reignites the terrifying essence of the Alien franchise while introducing new ideas that prevent it from feeling like a simple rehash. Under the direction of Fede Álvarez, the film returns to the claustrophobic horror that made the original Alien (1979) a masterpiece, but with a modern edge that keeps audiences on the edge of their seats. Álvarez wastes no time plunging the characters into a nightmare scenario, with the alien threat looming ominously from the start. What stands out in Romulus is how it focuses on the terror of isolation and the primal fear of the unknown, rather than relying solely on gore or large-scale action sequences. The practical effects combined with seamless CGI make the creature feel real, and its presence is truly bone-chilling. Álvarez knows how to play with light and shadow to keep the alien largely in the dark, increasing the suspense. When the Xenomorph does appear, it's in quick, brutal bursts, reminding the audience of its lethal efficiency. While Romulus is a thrilling return to form for the Alien franchise, it's not without its minor flaws. Some fans may find the film's slower pacing to be a drawback, especially those expecting a more action-heavy experience. There are moments where the plot feels predictable, leaning on familiar tropes from earlier films in the franchise. For long-time fans and newcomers alike, this film delivers a satisfying dose of terror, making it well worth an 8/10.",2024-10-08
513,SoumikBanerjee1996,Godzilla (2014) situation for the Alien Franchise!,6,"Visuals are stunning, and the sound design is incredible, presenting a technically proficient showcase. However, it falls short in delivering substantial 'content' pertaining to its central attraction, very much reminiscent of Godzilla (2014) experience.Now don't get me wrong, I like Fede Álvarez's vision; his gritty, detail-oriented approach is commendable and would certainly resonate with fans of the original Alien (1971).Yet, those who favor Cameron's interpretation (like me) may perceive it as lacking depth and insufficiently packed with the thrilling 'Alien' action they crave for.For me however, the most significant flaw lies in characterization. None of the characters or their familial or relational dynamic resonated with me, all of it failed to create the emotional impact I hoped for. As a result, the losses and tragedies suffered by the on board cred felt rather inconsequential, devoid of stakes and genuine empathy.",2024-10-16
514,banistersmind-43271,Romulus Wasn't Terrible!,7,I went into this movie completely cold. I avoided all trailers and listened to no commentary before seeing it and I ended up enjoying it a lot. It doesn't break new ground or read on what has come before it but it looks gorgeous. It's clear a lot of love went into the production and I appreciated the dedication to practical effects in the creature design. The performances from the young ensemble cast are decent also. Cailee Spaeney recalls Sigourney Weaver's performance in the original film where she has to think her way through the situations she's faced with. David Johnson's performance was solid and not knowing which way he'd go was a refreshing source of tension. I'm an old school Alien fan who has ridden the highs and lows of this franchise and Romulus - thankfully - doesn't suck.,2024-08-19
515,jasonlindell,Finally a decent Alien movie,8,"I didn't think I'd ever recover from the PTSD I sustained from the previous Aliens vs Predator entries/Prometheus movies so I was praying they would finally get it right with this one and they did.The Alien vs Predator and Prometheus movies had tons of plot holes/bad acting/unrealistic decisions made by characters. This one was so much better, the characters mostly made logical decisions for once. CGI was good, decent amount of action along with exposition. Saw it in imax and definitely had me tensing up a few times, brought back memories of seeing Alien/Aliens for the first time.So if you're a fan of the Alien movies or just good creature movies in general, I'd say it's worth a watch in cinemas. 8 out of 10.",2024-08-16
516,Tyler-426,An Ok TV Movie,6,"You know those movies where the camera seems to feel an irresistible urge to crawl up the actor's noses? Well, this movie isn't one of them. In this movie the camera is virtually glued to the actor's noses.The difference between a cinema movie and a TV movie is that in a cinema movie you have wide open shots showing large scenes. Even when characters talk or interact, you always see several people at once, or the room or background they are in. On TV on the other side, when a character talks you will see a close-up picture of their face filling the entire screen. As if they were posing for a passport-picture. That's a no-no in the cinema in my book.Alien Romulus isn't a bad movie. It does lots of things right or at least not bad or entirely wrong. In fact, just about everything. With one glaring exception. It's filmed exactly like a TV movie. I estimate the average distance between the camera and any object filmed in the movie is 40, no make that 30 cm. - About 12 inches. Any time a character talks, or shows emotion, his or her face will fill the entire screen. Just like on TV. Boy, I've always wondered how all those little pores of the actors are doing... No, seriously, when a character walks up a stair, you will see a close-up of a sneaker stepping on a step. If a character walks down a corridor, you will see his or her back filling the screen, etc. If you like big shots and cinema movies, this film is not for you. If you don't mind close-up TV movies where the nose of actors fills the screen, you'll like this film. Otherwise Alien Romulus is a bit like a teenager slasher movie, with the slasher and theme replaced with aliens and outer space. Not too bad, if only it were filmed for the cinema. If you read this, Mr. Alvarez, please try to make your next movie with really big cinema shots!",2024-08-19
517,more-25266,A rustic visual masterpiece with torture!!,8,The cast is phenomenal. Their young and professional Finally a horror movie that gives you somes sense of an even playing field. The characters aren't dumb or cruel hearted. These things are just the perfect predator. The 2 leads should definitely be included in the next alien franchise. There's a throwback vibe to the design of the alien. Its not bad but it's not like the advance design we saw in alien covenant. It dosent hurt the film but the design is meh!! The a.i stold the show. David was just flat out errie regardless if he was helping or not. This a.i actually had me rooting for him. At least this is a sold movie that speaks volumes. In my book it's a solid 8. Oh and it's definitely a tortured character literally no spoilers over here though!!,2024-08-15
518,bendickc,Not Original,7,"Romulus is pretty much Aliens (2) with a few changes: Space Station Vs Colony, 20-something scrappers Vs marines. If you are going to re-make a classic, it should be for the better not make it worse.The set designs used the retro industrial tech of the original series vs the ultramodern tech of Prometheus which I viewed as a positive.The androids were well done and continued the theme that they cant be fully trusted not to turn on the humans.There were plenty of easter eggs and references to its heritage and the Alien universe.I would have liked to have seen a bit more originality and make the humans more likeable where you arent rooting for the Aliens to wipe out humanity.",2024-10-20
519,fan_yuhua,A typical American horror film,10,"I watched it, it's a miracle that this movie was released in China without any cuts. I have to thank the censorship. The scale of this movie is really large, the first half is a bit boring, but the second half is really scary, and the action design is also very exciting. Alien is really disgusting and terrifying (I haven't watched the first few Alien movies, I inexplicably feel that Alien is a bit like Venom...). The plot is almost non-existent, it's just a brainless and exciting movie (this movie has good special effects, it should be good to watch in the cinema, but unfortunately it's 2D). However, as a horror movie, it's still good, the atmosphere is strong, the characters are quite clich é d (classic horror movies don't make immortal), and they all have a saintly heart, but biomimicry. The setting of the younger brother is quite interesting (the smartest one among them...), but with such a scale, the plot is no longer important.",2024-08-22
520,blackeyed0225,Alien: Romulus,6,"Anyone who fears enclosed spaces and suffers bouts of chest pains when watching horror movies should think twice before delving into this reworking of Alien, Ridley Scott's 1979 sci-fi horror classic. Featuring 'xenomorphs', 'facehuggers', and 'chestbursters', this is nightmare fuel that fits within Uruguayan writer-director Fede Alvarez's grotesque wheelhouse (Evil Dead remake, Don't Breathe). His knack for gory spectacle allows his films to be enjoyed on a visceral level, but his screenplay (with Rodo Sayagues) sticks too closely to the original, prioritizing fan service and slick visuals over an original story.On an off-world mining colony where the sun never shines, work buys you freedom, but that's not the case for young itinerant worker, Rain, whose contract is extended by her employer, Weyland-Utani, an interstellar megacorporation that makes ExxonMobil look like the Salvation Army. She and her brother Andy, who's actually a synthetic human reprogrammed to serve as her guardian, are enticed by the promise of escape from the drudgery to a better world. Their ticket out? Rain's ex-boyfriend and his crew need Andy's tech capabilities to exploit the abandoned spacecraft that'll take them there. They embark on a scheme riddled with unknowns, scavenging a derelict spaceport named Romulus, which results in the release of unformed organisms collected by Weyland-Yutani. No prizes for guessing what happens next.H. R. Giger's alien design, a spindly insectoid monstrosity with acid for blood, remains awesome. In its transformation from parasite to hunter, a perverse sense of anticipation is at play as the knowing audience braces for the inevitable. The human 'heroes' are the typical lambs delivering themselves to the slaughter, yet Callee Spaeny's enigmatic protagonist Rain proves to be an exception, with juvenile looks that mask tenacity and composure under fire, perhaps mirroring too closely Sigourney Weavers's unflappable heroine Ellen Ripley. The moments between Rain and Andy (David Jonnson, a show stealer) are good-they exist as each other's key to survival. Old analog tech is prominent in the set design of the Romulus, complementing a dusty palette of sepia, red, and black. When hell breaks loose, the tense set pieces crackle and hum with feral intensity, but the decision to revive a character from Scott's original is less convincing.Alvarez happily leverages the bloodletting that uses the alien's physiology in cool new ways (hello, zero gravity acid!) But these bold strides aren't matched when it comes to advancing the mythology. Ridley Scott attempted to demystify the alien species in Promethus (2012) and Covenant (2017), but this back-to-basics approach confirms that the studio is targeting a younger audience. The alien 'xenomorph' evolves throughout its lifecycle; unfortunately, the same can't be said for this film series.",2024-10-19
521,Camerenth,A familiar structure but with modern horror,9,"To summarize it all, the structure of the movie is what you have seen before if you've seen any alien movie but the execution, technological advances, and visceral style of more recent horror movies make the movie stand out.That being said the phrase ""if it ain't broke don't fix it"" I fee applies to this movie more than most movies have recently. It's has way more horror and gruesome elements than most movies before and has a unique style that Fede brings to this movie. And the movie is just beautiful to look at. The practical sets and beautiful space cgi is done so well.The emotion in this movie is focused between the Main character Ray and another character that I won't spoil.Overall it's more of what I love about the best of the Alien franchise just done again. And nothing is wrong with that.",2024-08-16

Using the technology style from the original Alien helps this tremendously and overrides what I say below making it into a strong contender for the top 3 Alien moviesThe bad bits
The age of the cast is too young and makes the plot as a whole unbelievable considering the equipment they have legitimate access to at the start as well as the opening act on land feels allot like a modern bad Star Wars TV show, combined with the heavy diversity casting for the sake of it gives it a B movie feelWorth seeing.",2024-09-06
523,Mynameisroman,finally a good alien movie,8,The first two alien movies are still the best. This one might get 3rd place. This movie takes the best things of the alien movies and put them into this one with a few changes. They added a lot of ideas and turned the whole thing into a really good movie. The technology looks more like the one in the first alien movies. Kinda old but still advanced and futuristic. The alien also looks pretty good since its all practical effects. The music and sound effects are great. Overall great entertainment. There are only a few things i didn't like. There was a lot of fan service going on. Repeating some well known lines from the previous movies. That can be fun of course but for my taste it was too much. The other thing i didn't like too much was a certain CGI Character. I think they should have uses a real actor but those are the two things i didn't like too much. In the end i enjoyed the movie a lot.,2024-08-16
524,jamesathens,Nothing close to the Alien series we have loved,6,"There was no escalation whatsoever; random events occurred without any clear motivation or reason, leaving the story feeling disjointed. The script had moments that were somewhat convincing, but by the midpoint of the movie, I found myself indifferent to the fates of the characters. The horror recipe attempts to return to the basics and original simplicity that once defined the genre, bringing back old, familiar patterns and tropes. However, instead of revitalizing the experience, it ends up recycling the same worn-out tricks and clichés that have plagued this now-tired franchise, offering nothing new or compelling. Despite occasional glimmers of potential, the film ultimately fails to deliver the suspense and tension that horror fans crave, leaving it feeling like a pale imitation of its former self.",2024-09-02

It was odd how they awkwardly crammed in most of the nostalgic references really. Is better than anything after Aliens, but that is a very low bar. The actors did a decent job, nothing against them generally.Just another money grab by the studios it feels like to me. Better than they have been since the 80s, but i still feel like i got my pocket picked.

Fede Álvarez and co-screenwriter Rodo Sayagues have created a masterful, entertaining, and audience-pleasing new addition to the genre. While it doesn't revolutionize the genre, it certainly allows for its continued progression.I hope Disney can approach this Franchise like Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell are treating The Evil Dead Series. Allow a new director to come in and pitch a new story and setting. I would love a new Alien movie every few years or so am I right?",2024-08-21

For the most part there was a strong real time vibe to things, which took something away from the Xenomorph elements. The creature development elements were quite inconsistent with this one, in relation to the in the other movies. I suppose you can pretend they were on the ship for at least a week, rather than 90 mins.In all other respects its a great time at the cinema, and a very enjoyable, tense, sometimes grim ride.",2024-08-18

Slow start admittedly but once it gets going it's like a freight train gaining momentum until the very last second of the movie.The 7.5 rating here I think is very low. My son and I watched this movie together and when I told him this was 7.5 on IMDb after the fact, he literally scoffed. In my opinion this was the best Aliens movie out there, just beating out the second and arguably the most popular in the series, Aliens. It was that good. Seriously. If you're a fan of the franchise you will NOT be disappointed. Fede Alvarez is obviously very talented and has a bright future ahead of him.",2024-08-16
529,pckq,ALIEN Fanfiction with mediocre cinematography,2,"When i first heard that Fede Alvarez was supposed to direct a new Alien franchise sequel i already knew this would suck. Just watched Alien Romulus, and guess what? It sucks, lol.Alvarez is No Ridley Scott and he is no James Cameron. Not even remotely. And thus he lacks the raw talent to pull this movie off properly. Motivated, yes. So Alien Romulus feels more like expensive fanfiction than an worthy new entry in the Alien Franchise. It might have worked as a TV episode. But as a feature film, it does not work.The new cast of characters here nobody will care if they live or die. The Ian Holm deepfake is incredibly poorly done. The cinematography is quite mediocre. The script has logic problems. A few lame jumpscare attempts throughout dont help this production either. . Some of the scenes here are lifted from the first two movies. I guess that was Mr. Alvarez's way of making sure the audience gets it that he is a huge Alien 1 & 2 fanboy.On the bright side the first 15 minutes are really well done, but as soon as the protagonists encounter their first extraterrestrials the whole thing falls off a cliff.I said this a few times before, but this is definitely my last Fede Alvarez directed Movie. Hopefully next time they get a director with more talent.",2024-11-21
530,MG_84,A familiar requel format of a film that gets better the fewer characters there are,6,"The visual and aural aspects were fantastic with great set design, atmospheric music pulled from the originals and practical effects which are far more effective than their CGI counterparts. It doesn't always capture the claustrophobic feeling of the original, but it does a good job of recreating the feel of the Alien universe.The format is pretty standard to the ""requels"" - rehash the same ideas, throw in some nostalgic references and a fresh-faced cast and call it new. If I asked you to name a film with a strong female lead where a member of a ship's crew is attacked by a parasite, leading to a new alien bursting out of the crew member's chest, which sets off a series of events whereby a fully grown Xenomorph hunts the rest of the crew around a spaceship that they're unable to escape from, where you're unsure of the motives of the droid crew-member, and a big final battle which requires our hero to get into a space suit...you might think I was talking about the 1979 original. Nope, that's this ""new"" instalment in the series too.If you've seen any of the original Alien films, you've effectively already seen this one. That said it's entertaining enough if you keep your expectations low, munch some popcorn, try to enjoy the ride and can look past some cheesy delivery of nostalgic lines from the series.Cailee Spaeny was fantastic as always and really showed up the lower quality acting from some of the others. She's no Sigourney Weaver/Ripley, but she does a good job. David Jonsson was also very good, and Isabela Merced's smaller role was performed well, but the rest felt a bit like an amateur school production of Alien was taking place.For me personally Bjorn was the most aggravating and annoying character and I was desperate to see the end of him. Maybe that was the intention, if so it was great writing and performance, but otherwise he was just nauseating to watch and listen to.Overall, I don't think you're going to hate it even if you loved some or all of the previous instalments, but you certainly shouldn't expect this to be an inventive or original instalment. The film gets better as it goes on due to fewer characters and more depth, but not enough to propel this beyond a nostalgic rehash.",2024-10-20
531,horacehung,Third best Alien film since Alien and Aliens!,8,"Roger Ebert, a famed American film critic, once commented on Alien(1979), ""A peculiarity of the rest of the actors is that none of them were particularly young."" He further made the point that ""these are not adventurers but workers,"" and it can be seen in the franchise that middle-aged actors are cast. Ebert might be right that many recent action pictures miscast young actors as key roles, but he would never have imagined that 10 years after his death, director Fede Álvarez retells the Alien story by focusing on a group of young space colonizers.The Alien franchise needs a breath of fresh air. Ridley Scott showed a creature unknown to the world, and the eerie, eccentrically aesthetic vision from H. R. Giger. James Cameron shot an action blockbuster between humans and Aliens. Following by the bleak, studio-intervened Alien 3(1992) and the unwanted, comedically off-tone Alien: Resurrection(1997), we wouldn't get another sequel (or I should say prequel) after 15 years, from the original director Ridley Scott. Scott wished to expand the Alien lore and explain its origins, the result was an Alien-identical film Prometheus(2012) and its lukewarm-received sequel Alien: Covenant(2017). Scott's prequel trilogy is likely impossible to finish, what fans want is not David's (the Android) evil masterplan, but a solid story that brings us back to the space horror when we first witnessed Alien(1979). I can tell you Alien: Romulus(2024), after 7 years of waiting, did it.Director Fede Alvarez is perhaps the best choice to direct. His directorial debut Evil Dead(2013) showed he could revitalize a beloved horror franchise without leaning too much on the clichés. His next original project Don't Breathe(2016) proved his talent for evoking fear and horror given a limited setting and budget. Alien: Romulus was supposed to be sent directly to streaming (like the Predator prequel Prey in 2022) but was greenlit with theatrical release, and I'm glad about that.Romulus pays homage to its predecessor and dares to surprise us with new elements (which every horror reboot should). We began with scenes that deepened bonds between Rain (Cailee Spaeny) and Andy(David Jonsson). This is when Fede already decided to take a turn - we should trust the Android, Andy was a brother to Rain. Unlike in Prometheus and Covenant where David (Michael Fassbender) was antagonistic to humans and god-complexed, Andy was still trustworthy. This underlied the basis for later life-threatening scenes where Rain truly cared about her Android, and was a more optimistic view of the human-robot bond.The cinematography from Galo Olivares and the score from Benjamin Wallfisch were both amazing. Especially the overall look of the colonized planet and the spaceship resembles the 80s cyberpunk, akin to how Blade Runner(1982) looked. The orange, soft, dim lighting that permeates throughout the film highlights its cinematography and differentiates the dark, Giger-esque look from its predecessors.I love Cailee Spaeny in this film, but I expect a bit more screen time and performance from her. She was a lovely doll from Sofia Coppola's Priscilla(2023) and an inexperienced war journalist in Alex Garland's Civil War. One cannot expect her to completely replace Sigourney Weaver's Ripley. While Alien and Aliens included Ripley's bond with her crew and daughter-like relationship with Newt respectively, Romulus gave us the siblinghood between Rain and Andy. But Cailey certainly rules in certain scenes, while paying homage to Ripley, she shows she could be fierce in fighting xenomorphs under her lovely face and shines as a rising movie star.New elements such as gravity control or body temperature at the facehugger chamber are creative. There's already little gimmick that the Alien story can play with, yet Fede proceeds to surprise us. Like everyone said, I was already satisfied with the first two acts, all the easter eggs, the practical effects and CG. But it is the third act that makes the film shine and deviates itself from another horror flick reboot. The ending is perhaps controversial (I wonder if fans like the idea) but I appreciate Fede's attempt to take the franchise in a new direction.Like I mentioned, a breath of fresh air.Follow me on Letterboxd: Kino_Barista.",2024-08-15
532,cahidi,Alien : What Now?!,7,"The setting of this new Alien movie is in space, so that reminds the audience of the very first movie. Where humans first fought the deadly race of alien. The main character of this movie is uninteresting enough to make the audience root for her. I guess it's the script writer's fault, not the actress. She's done her best with what's given to her. The plot is still the same : an unsuspecting human fell victim to the larvae form of the Aliens, their chest burst giving birth to the baby Xenomorph, then it grew exponentially fast, making itself a new threat to everyone on the ship. There's something new that sets this movie apart than its predecessors, though. You'll see it near the end of the movie. All I can tell you that it's messed up and freaky! Be prepared to get grossed out!",2024-10-27

But I still went to see it since I love me some Alien.Well first things first, the special effects are top notch. Secondly - it's better than Alien Covenant. And thirdly as much as I thought teenagers being edgy and annoying is going to decrease my enjoyment - it wasn't very jarring. Soon enough I forgot about every character being young and started to enjoy the movie for what it is: a good summer blockbuster that has quite a few surprises in stock that weren't spoiled by the original trailer.Does it live up to Alien or Aliens - hell no. But it's still a good Alien movie that you shouldn't miss out on.So for everyone who loves Alien franchise - go and see the movie. It's surprisingly good - and personally I enjoy when a movie surpasses my expectations.",2024-08-26
534,danielcereto,Thank you Fede Alvarez,6,"I am a big fan of Alien 1979 and Aliens 1986, they're two of my favorites of all time. I have watched them probably more than twenty times in my life. By the way, I grew up in the 80's so I am enough old to compare Alien Romulus with the original ones.Anyway, first of all thank you Fede Alvarez to make me happy respecting the original story and doing a great job giving us nostalgia from different times.But maybe, at the same time that's the big mistake here. Sometimes Alien Romulus seems great, different but many times a bad remix of Alien, Aliens and even Prometheus. The problem here is the cast is really bad excepting the Androids. To add, less bullets and blood.So, consequently Alien Romulus could have been far better but far worse. Fede tries to follow the legacy but it doesn't work overall as a great movie. Everything that happens can be guessed easily from beginning till the end. Too familiar for fans.Anyway, nothing is perfect and Alien Romulus can be a great introduction for Gen Z, but probably not the favorite for old fans like me. Thank you Fede for the try. Alien Romulus will be my fourth favorite from the Saga. I recommend to watch in this order: Alien, Aliens, Prometheus and Alien Romulus.",2024-10-17
535,tomasz-wiszkowski,"In the Dystopian world, what's left of anyone's dreams gets crushed by stark reality",9,"The movie is very focused on details. You will see there bits and pieces you may recognize from other movies and games settled in that universe.The story happens sometime after the first story (Alien) took place, possibly around or after second one too.The dystopian nature of the world is perfectly captured in the early stages of the movie, and reminded frequently as the story evolves, as if Weyland Yutani was a North Korean - Soviet venture. The ""Dark"" dystopian nature of this world only turns Darker, and as far as Aliens (2nd story) is concerned, it is pretty darn dark right from the start.The movie brilliantly uses complete silence (absence of any sound) and I have to say, it says a lot more than any kind of music would.The plot is not very complicated, and if you're expecting an intellectual movie - you should look elsewhere. Aliens are also somewhat less aggressive, if not hesitant at times, which appears to turn off some of the more demanding viewers.This is definitely a movie I'll watch again. First two parts have set a high bar for any Alien movie, a bar that was never quite matched by anything that came after, but there's no world in which this movie is worth a single star. It is really pretty darn good.",2024-08-17
536,javier_8,Here's my problem: it's a movie for fans.,6,"I'm a big fan of the Alien franchise. My wife isn't.So we saw the movie and by the end I was thinking ""finally! A good alien movie"" and when I asked her if she liked it (I was sure she'd agree) she was like ""meh... not really"".First I was surprised she didn't like it, but then I noticed that I actually liked it because of a few nostalgic references. If you remove those, you don't really have a good movie, just an average sci-fi horror survival film.So most of the references (Ash/Rook, MU-TH-UR, ""get away from her"", ""you have my sympathies"", etc...) are there to make you feel you're in the same universe, but the movie doesn't continue the story. It just doesn't feel like canon, it feels like a spin-off. This movie could have easily been written with chat-gpt and then added the Alien elements. It's an average monster survival film.The story, basically, they arrive at a space station, aliens are there, they need to escape. Couldn't be simpler, no David with intricate plans, no Mr. Weyland looking for a fountain of youth... damn, this movie even makes the prequels look awesome.Acting... average. Only Andy stands out as a good performance / interesting character.Visuals? STUNNING, one good thing we could all agree is that the planet/ships visuals are awesome.Finally, It's a fan service movie with a mediocre plot and (maybe) one element that could carry on to make more $equel$.",2024-08-24

Too many repeated lines wedged into a similar scene.A great movie should have you anticipating what is next. This movie clobbers you over the head with overloud flinch moments which never made me flinch. I was not shocked or scared by anything. Half way through I was hoping it would end soon but it didn't end soon enough.Too many things failed to suspend my disbelief. And the ending was so predictable right down the the final statement by the main character.It failed like that one Rocky movie, which was at least redeemed by Rocky Balboa. There may be no redemption for Romulus.",2024-08-21
538,movieliker1,"Not great, not bad.",6,"I guess it's okay. Good special effects, action, and acting. Except for the over used horror trope of the characters running around like frightened ninnies.I understand a horror movie would not be as frightening if any character would act in a brave, calm, cool collected manner. But it is annoyingly redundant and lacking in originality and imagination to constantly throw stupid imbeciles at the screen and expect anyone except stupid imbeciles to relate.To be honest, the main character (Rain played by Cailee Spaeny) is kind of smart and resourceful. But she ain't brave, calm, cool and collected. I quickly got tired of the constant look of panic on her face, and in her acting.(I mean these characters are stealing a space ship, to raid a damaged ship, to escape to a planet they are not authorized to go to, that is supposed to take years to get to. Did they really think there would be no danger involved? I know they never expected to run into deadly aliens. But come on, danger is danger. And weenieing out into full panic mode --- these kids were never qualified for the original mission.)And I know it's just silly entertainment. But the premise doesn't make sense. As often reported, the Nostromo was obliterated in the first movie Alien by three nuclear explosions. So to have any of it still intact makes no sense. And Ripley blew the first alien out of the escape shuttle. So how did it end up back in this movie?And how illogically convenient Rain's companion is a pacifist android. Her father left it to take care of his daughter. Wouldn't an android armed with self defense abilities be better at taking care of his daughter, than a wimpy pacifist everybody beats up just for fun?For me, nothing will compare to the first movie. Because I was much younger then, and no scifi horror movie had ever been made like this before. Until the first Alien movie, all previous scifi movies were campy B movies with silly special effects.And I personally find suspense and mystery more frightening than action and easy to see monsters. The first Alien movie left a lot to the imagination. And I think what we don't know or understand is more scary than what we can easily see.But once again, I know the target audience is teens and twenty year olds. Not anybody old enough to have seen the original when it first came out. And more likely not to be tired of horror movie tropes yet.6 out of 10 for me.",2024-11-22
539,pranayjalvi,Balance of tense moments and thrilling climax,8,"Alien: Romulus plays the hits, but crucially remembers the ingredients for what makes a good Alien film, and executes them with stunning craft and care. While ""Romulus"" is a bit overstuffed, it's also never boring, and at its best it's one of the scariest rides you can take at the movies this summer.Alien: Romulus's back-to-basics approach to blockbuster horror boils everything fans love about the tonally-fluid franchise into one brutal, nerve-wracking experience. Alvarez gives Spaeny her hero moments, whether in her care of her comrades or destroying an invasive species, and she expresses the inner strength and utter determination to survive required of an ""Alien"" franchise installment. Romulus proves that forty-five years after the xenomorph first terrified audiences, there's still plenty of acid-bloody life left in the franchise's monstrous bones.My Rating : 8/10.",2024-08-24
540,jon-22643,This film is using all the gimmicks from prior movies,7,"The movie is ok, not great and not bad, if you are a fan of Alien movies you must watch this and you will recognize many ideas taken from prior movie, and I mean all 6.The idea is basic one which appears in all movies, which is a group of people who arrive into a place full of.. you know, and you also know what will happen to them, to the leading actors, and to the monsters. It's all so predictable, from start to end.Still I liked it, because it's part of the franchise, and I'm a loyal returning customer, I'm also a freak of similar movies such as Predator, fact is they all follow the same formula in all movies, but who doesn't enjoy seeing humans fight monsters and win, especially when it's a girl kicking their ass?What is did not like the fact that most of the characters are stupid, with bad judgment, who doesn't think. Maybe it's a hint on today's young generation. Too many times I find myself saying ""what an idiot"".The actors are doing a good job, not great.Bottom line - they could have done a much better film, but I thank the production for this movie as too many years passed since the last one and I'm waiting for the next one, hopefully they will be able to generate better films in the future, the plot can be much better.",2024-10-18
541,psychofox-88511,"It's great, but it could have been even better...",7,"I'm not going to spend too much time reviewing the film in detail - plenty of people have already done that - but I will say that it was great to see the return to the dark. Claustrophobic environments that are as much a part of what the franchise should be as the titular creature.The use of old-fashioned chunky keyboards, monochromatic CRT screens and sleepy computers, as well as the general sense of industrial grime in the locations really marked back to the original films in the best possible way.The apparent choice to base the visuals of the mining planet after another Rodley Scott masterpiece (Blade Runner) was also a brilliant touch.Unfortunately, this reliance on the source movies was the main thing that I felt kept Romulus from really being outstanding.There are so many references to previous films, often shoe-horned in clumsily (""Get away from her, you b*tch!""), that they became distracting. I'd have much preferred if the film had stood on its own two feet rather than constantly making blatant callbacks to the earlier films.I also felt that it tried to do too much, by incorporating elements from almost all of the Alien cannon - even entries many fans may not have cared to be reminded of. It's like it was trying to be the glue that tied the whole franchise together, when all it needed to do was telling a good story in a style that was faithful to the original.While these issues really disappointed me, I can say that the film itself did not. Despite the unwelcome distractions and endless, unnecessary callbacks, I thoroughly enjoyed Romulus, and did feel like I was returning to the universe of the original films for the first time in decades.",2024-09-13
542,MovieWarfare,Alien Isolation vibes,8,"Crazy to think that the first Alien movie came out in 1979 and is one of the most pivotal science fiction movies in history. It also managed to get a sequel in 1986 that managed to be even better and become another pivotal movie in Sci-fi. Sadly, every other entry in this franchise has not been remotely as good. Is Alien Romulus the first actual good Alien movie since 1986?The story itself is straightforward but what makes this entry great is the main core of the story, the brother and sister relationship between our main characters. Rain played by Cailee Spaeny is the heroine of this movie. She does a great job and her character is very likeable. It is also a joy to see her not be one of those characters who make dumb decisions which you see in many horror movies. Her brother Andy played by David Jonsson who does a terrific job in the role. Both David and Cailee have great chemistry and you root for their survival throughout the whole of the movie. This entry goes back to the horror roots of the original Alien and it is done very effectively in Romulus. There are some genuinely tension-inducing scenes including one that pays homage to the game 'Alien: Isolation' that is terrific. Fede is well known for body horror and he continues to deliver disgusting scenes here as well.I appreciate how they bring back the gritty and dark look from the older Alien entries for this one. The world and the ship look dirty and dark which further elevates the creepiness. The practical sets are phenomenal with lovely practical effects for some of the Facehuggers and Xenomorph scenes. CGI is still used a fair amount but they look good for the most part. The cinematography is great with how it conveys the unsettling and claustrophobic nature of the ship. The sound design and the score are amazing in the way they help make the scenes feel incredibly tense.The movie isn't perfect though. The rest of the crew apart from the main characters are very forgettable. The movie doesn't fully delve into any of the other characters apart from 1 or 2 lines about them. Instead of rooting for their survival, you just know they are fodder and want to see how they die. The iconic Xenomorphs don't start to appear until halfway and even then, they don't appear much. The major threat is really the Facehuggers but they start to appear too much to the point that you want to see something else now. The final act might also be a bit divisive to people. The first two acts are homages to the previous Alien movies but the final act is something else entirely. It is insanely weird and you're going to either love it or hate it. They also bring back an actor from the dead using current tech and it sounds as bad as you think. The CGI is very obvious.Overall, it is nice to finally have a proper enjoyable Alien movie in such a long time. It does make me wonder where they can go with this franchise though. It will be extremely overdone if we keep getting another survivors who are attacked by Aliens on a ship or planet story again. What made Aliens great was that it did something drastically different from the first. Hopefully, with the success of Romulus, we can get a bolder Alien movie in the future.",2024-08-17
543,Shadwellarmy,Great addition to the franchise,8,"I went to see the film in IMAX and would highly recommend doing the same to get the full experience. It's a different take on the nightmare that is the Alien universe, which I really liked and think this is a great addition to an already awesome franchise. I don't think you can beat the original Alien and Aliens as they stand out as two of the best sci-fi horror films of all time, however Romulus does a good job and taking the concepts of the originals and applying them to a new story and a new cast. The story does a good job of linking past and present and I think they did it justice. The use of the face huggers was a great touch as they can be seriously scary in their own right. My only criticism is the bad CGI used for one of the characters faces and the liberty taken with the pace of the Aliens gestation. I'd love to see what was left on the cutting room floor as there is clearly an extended timeline in some of the excluded footage. I'm looking forward to the next one though as there is clearly a future story based on the ending.",2024-08-18
544,MartianTom,"In space, no one can hear you weep!",1,"I've watched every film in the Alien franchise several times over the years. Each of them, in their own ways, has something unique to bring - and each of them, in their own ways, still succeeds in all the essential stakes: the characterisation, the performances, the cinematography, the quality of the writing and direction, the effects... and that sense of jeopardy that grows and grows, like the alien monster itself, almost from the first scene.So I had no hesitation actually buying this instead of renting it, given the strength of its heritage. It's twenty quid, sadly, that I'll never see again. I'd have been better off putting it on a 500-to-1 outsider in a pram race.Within 5 minutes, I knew how bad it was. Dreadful dialogue, trying to be so sharp and cool in appealing to the Gen-Z TikTok-aholics who'll doubtlessly make up its main audience. I think it was actually written by one of them. A teen, certainly. Either that or they just picked up a bunch of street kids from South London and got them to improvise all the way through it. Dreadful, empty, dull characters with not a single one to feel sympathy for or root for. No sense at all of drama or jeopardy. And, given the decades of advances in CGI, AI and other film-making tech since the original (which holds its own even now), this still managed to look like it was filmed in a warehouse on an industrial estate in Benfleet.40 minutes was enough for me... and I only got that far because I was hoping to see some of these dumb-clucks smashed to bits by the monsters and at least find some sense of my moneysworth that way. But no... I couldn't even make it that far.How the hell can Ridley Scott allow his name to be attached to this heap of garbage? Does he need the money.Cailiee Spaeney caught my eye in 'Civil War' as an upcoming talent to watch out for. But she was completely wasted in this. And she was the only talent in it. And that includes not only cast, but crew too.I implore all Alien franchise devotees... please... just pretend this one doesn't exist.You won't miss anything.",2024-10-21
545,glumski,The Star Wars VII of the Alien franchise,7,"Remember when you came out of the cinemas after watching 'Star Wars VII: The Force Awakens', wondering why someone had made a film out of some teen's Star Wars fanfiction? Fede Alvarez has now done the same thing to the Alien franchise, compiling all the cool stuff of the Alien franchise (predominantly 'Alien', 'Aliens', 'Prometheus', and 'Alien: Isolation') into one movie without really understanding why those things were cool in the first place.Meet Rain Carradine (Cailee Spaeny), a teenaged or young adult worker in the capitalist mining hellhole Jackson's Star. Together with her synthetic ""brother"" Andy (David Jonsson), she's trying and failing to make ends meet after the death of her parents in said capitalist hellhole mines. When her ex-boyfriend Tyler (Archie Renaux) and his friends come up with the idea of scavenging a suddenly-in-orbit derelict spacecraft to escape to another planet that has actual sunlight, Rain reluctantly agrees to help. Unfortunately for the young crew, said derelict spacecraft turns out to be a space station, where Weyland-Yutani researched the original xenomorph from the Nostromo.While the premise raises some questions (Why do have these young people have a spacecraft? Why did the space station appear in orbit without anyone else noticing?), it works well enough to get our intrepid characters into the same place as their future alien friends. What proceeds is the usual Alien-inspired horror, where facehuggers do their thing, synthetic humans do their thing, a bunch of xenomorphs do their thing, and the franchise does its thing with portraying pregnancies/childbirth in yet another new nightmare-inducing fashion. This is fine and works as well as any Alien movie.What doesn't work all that well is the contrived story. Things happen purely to get the plot moving. Remember the action movie trope where the characters escape a room just a second before it explodes? That happens, like, five times in short succession. Remember those action movie car chase scenes, where the completely out of control car flies through the air and lands exactly in the right position without any consideration of chance or probability? That happens, just with a space ship? Remember all the many scenes where the antagonist gloats instead of killing the protagonist, only for some deus ex machina to get him? That, too, happens. It's really extremely dumb, even after suspending all disbelief.Moronic plot aside, the movie does well. The aesthetics are incredibly pleasing; I absolutely love the retro-futuristic style of the original 'Alien' movie (as well as the 'Alien: Isolation' video game). It's fantastically done. The soundtrack doesn't quite meet the chilly atmosphere of the original 'Alien' movie but works well enough. The visual effects are cool, and the sound is great. The characters are fairly forgettable with the exception of Rain and Andy. For some reason there is a creepy CGI version of Ian Holm playing an android; this was entirely unnecessary and should not have been done.While the screenwriters had some new ideas with regard to the use of temperature and gravity, a whole bunch of concepts were heavily inspired by 'Alien: Isolation' (which, unfortunately, has a considerably better story than 'Alien: Romulus'). The movie also managed to fabricate the dumbest depiction of an astronomical phenomenon with its practically solid Saturn-like planetary ring, but I guess a more realistic ring wouldn't have yielded the same effect of once again (well, twice again) escaping at the very last second.Nevertheless, 'Alien: Romulus' manages to be an engaging movie, mostly due its fantastic aesthetics, the stellar acting by Spaney and Jonsson, and perhaps the shock value of the third act. It just might be the third best movie in the franchise, but only manages to do so by default of the other movies being terrible. If someone capable of logical thinking had proofread the screenplay, the movie might've been actually really good.",2024-08-24

Not over the top silly gore fest like so many newer films.Aside from one call back line (which was a bit of a cringe), the Easter eggs, homages, and nods to the original were spot on.Great fun for fans of the original trilogy.

547,DanTheMan2150AD,Back to basics,8,"Simultaneously honouring its nightmarish predecessors while chest bursting at the seams with new frights of its own, Romulus injects some fresh acid blood into the Alien franchise after 7 long years of hypersleep. Despite an over-reliance on lore-heavy exposition, director Fede Àlvarez delivers a great venture that is aesthetically a remarkable modern recreation of the world that O'Bannon and Scott created with the original, using the environment's unique elements to draw out all forms of tension. Even with its agonisingly slow and jumbled start, the film quickly picks up offering a handful of shock-repulsion moments that leave you feeling grossed out and adrenalised. Granted there's not much to its characters but the cast provides exceptional performances that match, David Jonsson's Andy being the standout for me. A lot of my niggles come from the film's reverence for the previous outings, it stops dead at one point to ask if you still remember the events of Prometheus, repurposes iconic lines so they seemingly lose all impact; the look of Rook was ever so slightly off, combining animatronic work with CG touch-ups, it doesn't look quite right, especially given how much this film prides itself on its practical work. Benjamin Wallfisch's music is a mixed bag for me, often cropping up at the most inappropriate times but for the large majority of the runtime does the job very well. Àlvarez knows what makes the franchise work and doesn't stray too far from the familiar but builds its reputation with stunning results, Alien: Romulus finally returns us to the simple sweatiness and anxiety of the original while providing a greatest hits remix of the other entries. It's not perfect, but it's damn good.",2024-08-18
548,psgorio,"Not Quite A Perfect Organism, But Good Enough.",8,"Member berry moments aside, this was probably easily the 3rd best Alien movie in its saga. I know that might not mean much to some, but for a pretty hefty fan of the franchise like myself, that statement carries and can hold enough weight to move mountains. Even with the callbacks and nods to previous Alien films, Romulus does so with a touch of class, delivering a familiar yet fresh take on the long running movie series that tells a different tale while managing to hit all of the tropes the Alien movies we all know and love. The plot, without spoiling anything, is simple yet becomes more and more complex as the movie progresses telling the tale of desperate youths trying to escape a derelict mining colony run by the seedy Weyland-Yutani corporation and find better lives. What comes to follow is something quite awesome as the solid pacing allows the tension to continue to build until it culminates to such a stunning climax that I was left with my jaw agape by the time the credits rolled. My only gripe with this film is really being the reliance on the past films being used as a crutch to have the movie make it known that it's trying to appeal to longtime fans of the series by making it somewhat feel a bit derivative. However with that being said it is no way as derivative as say Star Wars The Force Awakens was, for example. It isn't a simple cut and paste. What Romulus does so well lies in it's nuanced story segments that tend to toss you a curve ball here and there to make you really feel like it's trying to stand on it's own two legs at times even while playing the Alien hits. The acting is also pretty stellar as well. Cailee Spaeny is going places as the lead in this. She is vulnerable yet tough when the chips are down and her friend Andy does just as good of a job portraying a compassionate yet sinister android companion. (Side note: I also wish she would have been chosen to play Ellie in The Last of Us show as she just has a look and feel to her that somewhat screams out Ellie.) Overall, Romulus sets a new bar and standard for any future Alien and heck even horror movies as it exceeds mostly all expectations and creates a tense, beautifully shot, smart and clever atmospheric sci-fi horror Alien film that takes it back to it's basic roots with a nice few surprises to be had along the way by the time you reach that credit roll.",2024-09-26

Also, they shoud've tried to get Hailee Steinfeld, they already have someone that looks like her, so why not her? It's like an investment, pay her more and get an extra 20 - 40 million dollars at the box office because people recognize her nameIn general, this movie is better that all 4 previous Alien Movies and except for the ending, it deserves a 9 out of 10.",2024-11-15

And I gotta say he did a really good job making an Alien movie come to life to the BIG SCREEN possible!Cailee Spaeny, and David Jonsson have brought their best performances, Cailee was on the spotlight when she gave us some final girl Ripley vibe, and Jonsson steals the show with an intelligent robot as Andy.This movie took place during the first movie that was made in 1979, and it's pretty similar to 1986's ""Aliens"" that was made by James Cameron. It had some pretty good scary moments and had some good Easter egg vibes from many Alien franchise.And it was pretty much better than ""Alien: Covenant"", because they were like some moments from Covenant, that didn't quite catch my attention. But with Romulus, though that quickly got my attention there.What a pretty good Alien film indeed.9/10.",2024-10-16
551,daninostop,"A Solid Return to the Franchise, but Not Without Flaws",7,"Alien: Romulus delivers a thrilling return to the dark, atmospheric world that made the original Alien films iconic. Set in a far-off colony where a new group of survivors face the relentless xenomorph threat, this installment builds tension in a manner reminiscent of the franchise's roots. The film successfully captures the claustrophobic terror that fans love, with some truly nerve-wracking moments that keep you on the edge of your seat.The visuals are striking, with impressive creature design and a gritty, immersive setting that feels like a natural continuation of the Alien universe. Director Fede Álvarez brings his own flair to the franchise, blending horror and action, much like the early films. The performances are generally strong, particularly from the lead, whose resilience and vulnerability make for a compelling character.However, where Romulus falters is in its pacing and story. While the buildup is effective, the middle portion drags slightly, and some of the character arcs feel underdeveloped. The film also doesn't offer much new in terms of lore, leaning heavily on familiar beats from previous Alien films. There are moments where it feels like a rehash of earlier plot points, rather than pushing the boundaries of the mythology.Overall, Alien: Romulus is a solid entry into the franchise that delivers the tension and horror fans expect. While it doesn't quite reach the heights of the original films, it's still an enjoyable and suspenseful experience. For longtime fans, it's a satisfying, if somewhat predictable, chapter in the Alien saga.",2024-10-21

Each actor seems perfectly cast, balancing the physicality and emotional weight needed to survive in the bleak, alien-infested universe.What stands out most is how the movie revisits and reinterprets the mythic elements of the Alien series. The xenomorph's evolution, the moral dilemmas of synthetic life, and humanity's fragile place in the cosmos are explored in ways that feel fresh yet faithful to the original vision. The film's bold direction and spectacular visual effects also ensure that it both honors the legacy of its predecessors while confidently carving its own space in the franchise.Overall, it's a fantastic return to form, reminding us why Alien remains such a powerful and enduring sci-fi horror franchise.

There is a good sence if threat but it comes from the situation, not the creature. The monster could've just been something else. It's like a prop in an action catastrophe movie. It seems the art of building up suspense slowly, filming a dark space ship, creating an eerie atmosphere, where something is lurking in the dark, was lost in main stream movies. The creature seems more like another problem, than the main antagonist. It's a shame, since imo it's the most iconic movie monster ever. The movie is not terrible but way overhyped, reminding me more of a fighting game than a horror movie.",2024-08-23

Cool monster scenes, creepy atmosphere, building tension. Just solid popcorn fun. And that's what this is.Also I love how many real sets and prop monsters they use. Significantly improved the viewing experience. CGI overkill movies are tiring.And though some people might fault the movie for less interesting characters - frankly, who cares? It's alien, it doesnt need to be deep.I appreciate Ridley Scott in the same way I appreciate Tom Cruise and the mission impossible movies. You know you're just going to see a fun well filmed movie with a lot of practical effects.And it's really nice to just be able to watch a good popcorn fun movie without getting bashed over the head by Hollywood forcing a political message for making some kind of heavy-handed social statement. More directors need to get the message that we don't need that forced into movies.Give us more movies like this. Simple, fun and well made. Good guys versus bad guys (in this case monsters), cool effects.So is it the greatest movie of all time? Of course it's not.It's just a fun monster movie. And a really well made one.I'm sure there's going to be people dissecting plot holes etc. To those people I would say just relax for 2 hours and enjoy a fun movie. Don't overthink it.",2024-08-25
555,henry8-3,Alien: Romulus,7,"When young Rain Carradine discovers she has to keep working in the mine beyond her original contract date, she accepts a friend's offer to join a team to get hold of some stasis pods which they can use to sleep for 9 years and travel to a planet with better living conditions. They arrive at the ship / station which is abandoned and partly destroyed and search for the pods. They are however not alone.Certainly the best Alien film since Aliens and paying considerable deference to both, particularly the first one - watch out for the many references - it even dips its toe in Alien Resurrection and Prometheus. Indeed it is not entirely unreasonable as some critics have done to accuse it of taking on board a good deal of the original story; which it does. The performances though are fine, particularly from Cailee Spaeny, sort of inheriting a touch of the Ripleys whilst David Jonson as a slow, confused android 'brother' to Rain is terrific. There is much to enjoy here, albeit purists may, repeat may, have issues with the 3rd act. That aside it provides a number of impressive action sequences and most importantly it returns to the provision of lots of blood, goo and some genuinely tense, even scary - in space no one can hear you scream stuff. Great fun.",2024-08-16
556,ruelshepperd,An unfortunate disappointment,5,"I had high hopes for this film. It looked like a back to basics Alien film with a stronger focus on horror, simpler characters and a single setting. The first half an hour was certainly quite solid, with good build-up, cool visuals and a cool set-piece. But at a certain point, character stupidity, poorly paced escalation and lore inconsistencies squander the good will I initially had.To be positive, the film looks and sounds fantastic. The emphasis on practical effects pays off marvellously. The atmosphere is fantastic, the cinematography excellent and the sound design is top notch. This film is a visual marvel. The characters are also fairly well-established, all having distinct personalities. The performances are strong, with the standouts being Cailee Spaeny and David Jonsson.But that is it for the positives as at a certain point, the plot becomes driven by stupid decisions, extreme coincidences and baffling moments. Characters suddenly make foolish decisions, which only serves to stretch out the plot and facilitate the third act. There are errors of continuity and worldbuilding which don't add up given the circumstances. The more you scrutinise the writing, the more holes you will find.To make matters worse, the film is highly derivative of what has come before. References and fan service often appear, feeling out of place and unnecessary. The film lacks its own identity, almost everything it tries to do has been done better by Alien and Aliens. At a certain point, the third act becomes a nightmare as baffling moment after baffling moment rears its head. The film should have featured one or two Xenomorphs, rather than escalating the situation rapidly.Overall, I was disappointed. The visuals, effects and sound cannot do much to salvage a plot riddled with holes, pushed forward by baffling choices and tiresome references. Just re-watch Alien and Aliens.",2024-09-09

Some say it is made for fans but you can just as easy see this one if you never saw any other alien movie.Acting is good, I really liked the main actress, She did a great performance. Story line is good, maybe a bit of a slow start but I think the build-up gives this movie a better story line. And besides... it makes the movie more realistic. Script is also decent.

Even though they said it's inspired by both Alien & Aliens, the movie itself its actually more like Alien & A:Isolation (videogame). It looks spectacular, a great and indeed welcome ""cameo"" used properly, and not just for the sake of having him there for 5sec, everything is literally based on Ridley Scott's vision, from monitors, sounds, effects, props and everything regarding ""Visuals"", i will give that to them. The soundtrack its not bad but also not great, it reprises the melodies of the first movie (again) but totally remade. I will not say much about the plot because we all know how it goes i think.... The PROBLEM with this movies is only 1...the cast! They're just bad it takes off credibility from the movie itself, they're childish and nonsensical, the protagonist and the android are actually good.

559,maxren17,Very effective revisit to the original Alien.,8,"There problems, it's flawed, but I still enjoyed. It's easy to sit back and criticize an artistic endeavor.The characters are excellently played by a slate of new actors. My only problem is in any sequel there's specter of familiar territory.With that said I was especially thrilled by the overall look of the film. Just the right light to give a hint of the creatures.I was slightly disappointed in the CGI segment. It sticks out like a stain on your crisp white linen shirt.But I quibble, it's an Alien movie! I'm all for that. I do want to call out the android. Excellent actor. When you see it you'll understand what I mean.",2024-08-18
560,buttkrieg,"Best Alien Movie in Years, Still Lacking",6,"Alien: Romulus was a pretty decent movie. I had high hopes for this, especially considering Fede Alvarez was at the helm for it. That being said, maybe my standards and expectations were a little too high. The movie is visually astounding. The special and practical effects really steal the show - which also kind of works as a drawback. Because it really overshadowed the characters and the story being told here. The characters themselves are very generic. You can see the effort from Fede to make these people relatable - and to an extent they are - but the actors really do not seem to carry any of the charisma to make their relationships or personalities work on screen. I didn't care for the ships crew at all, but there are a couple scenes that they do click together. That doesn't say a lot, but it worked once or twice. The final girl is nowhere near comparable to Ripley, and while people might say that's an unfair critique, I'd argue that it is because there was clearly a conscious effort to emulate that bad-ass female heroine come to fruition in the lead. She did her best, but it still felt a bit shallow. The rest of the crew was just... whatever.There were some neat kills, but most of them are pretty underwhelming... one of them is even spoiled in all of the trailers for the movie since the very beginning. There are a couple twists, but they're mostly predictable. Particularly when it comes with ""don't trust androids or Weyland..."" duh. The end of the movie did have a pretty unexpected turn that was very reminiscent of Alien: Resurrection. There are a lot of clear homages to earlier entries in the franchise, but they don't do a whole lot for the movie.Despite it's predictability and actors failing to flesh out their characters, it was still fun to watch, moreso than Prometheus and ESPECIALLY Alien: Covenant. For the sake of honesty, my biggest gripe was actually the lack of explicit carnage. This may have been my own fault hoping for ""Evil Dead 2013 in Space"" knowing the directors history. All in all, it was a good flick. That's the best I can say for it.",2024-10-27

She agreed and asked for it.Fan of all the previous Aliens and Co
Likes the story and especially the approach from the first Alien.Brilliant!!Not deasapointed at all!!Main actress Cailee Speay can roll on with the next ones like Sigourney Weaver.Liked all other Aliens since the first one who were more or less good but this one is my new favourite.Loved the scenery from the first one, actors and the story.Please keep it going like this with Cailee.So much more can be made this way.",2024-08-25

Was this a ""high school project"" to make another Alien movie? First off, the story sucks. It is ""succotash"". Oh I have an idea, let's just take a little bit of everything from all the outer space movies, throw it into a blender and presto, what do you get: ? It is a failed science project, not at all interesting. I feel sorry for Ridley Scott and Walter Hill. Now, ""Prometheus"" was original. ""Alien"" was original.

564,GJVazquez,A Thrilling Return to form for the Alien Franchise,9,"Alien: Romulus delivers unexpected thrills, proving to be an exhilarating experience for both long-time fans and newcomers to the *Alien* franchise. This movie exceeded my expectations, offering far more than a straightforward plot. It evolves into a gripping horror-thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. The pacing is spot-on, with no dull moments, as it thrusts a group of young characters into a dire situation they never imagined.The performances are strong across the board, but the ones that stand out to me are the performances from from Cailee Spaeny and David Jonsson. Spaeny shines as Rain, a character whose quick thinking and resourcefulness in critical moments left me impressed. The supporting cast also delivers solid performances. The atmosphere is masterfully crafted, capturing the eerie vibe that harkens back to the original *Alien* film. The attention to detail in the set design-from the corridors to the labs-perfectly mirrors the style of the Nostromo, adding to the film's authenticity.The CGI is generally impressive, though there are a few moments where it falls short and looks somewhat unnatural. (You'll see it when you see it) However, the Xenomorph itself is a standout, with the use of animatronics and puppetry adding a tangible realism that enhances the horror. The cinematography is top-notch, with beautifully composed shots that amplify the sense of dread, making every scene suspenseful and unpredictable. The story, characters, and world-building are all executed brilliantly, making this film a standout in the franchise.The film masterfully blends mystery, wonder, and horror, using the vastness of space to propel the story in intriguing and unexpected directions. Specially one particular moment that will leave you either thinking at the implications of what you just saw or just audibly saying WTF! (Another you'll KNOW when you see it)Fede Álvarez and his team have crafted something truly remarkable with Alien: Romulus. It's a film that not only respects its predecessors but also breathes new life into the Alien universe. I can't wait to see where they take the story next.",2024-08-17
565,tomdevisser29,"Weak story, amazing visuals",6,"This was the first Alien movie I've ever watched. I was a bit worried I might miss a lot of the plot, but honestly, there wasn't much to miss. The storyline is pretty thin, with some major plot holes-not because they weren't explained, but because they just didn't make sense.On top of that, the movie relies on some big clichés. While some of them worked well, others made the film quite predictable at times.Despite these flaws, the movie had some really strong moments, especially towards the end. Without giving too much away, it features one of the most terrifying and visually impressive enemies I've ever seen, which earned it the sixth star in my review.",2024-08-16
566,petersmichael-25066,It was good!,8,"I tried very hard to keep my expectations low before watching this film. I must say, it was a lot better than I expected it to be. It had an good amount of suspense, gore and action. The main 2 characters (Rain & Android) were believable and likeable. Visually, the film was stunning: It had a real, grim 70's feel to it. The special effects were very well done and the Alien looked real!Thanks to no dodgy CGI. The story plot was simple, but I was engaged throughout and had me on edge on several occasions. It doesn't compare to the OG Alien & Aliens (though there were subtle nods to the those two films) which was nice for the fans. Overall, I would put this quite high up in the franchise.",2024-08-18
567,ikal1,Get away from her you b***h!,7,"The story is predictable and simple-just as it should be. There are tons of references that take the viewer back to 1979 and 1986. The set design is fantastic, and on several occasions, I felt like I was traveling through time. I really missed the flamethrowers-not to nitpick, but that's how it is.All in all, this is a masterfully shot, endlessly entertaining, and visually fantastic film. However, this movie doesn't bring anything new and can only be seen as a homage to earlier films.The ending unnecessarily shifts the focus to the Alien films made in 2012 and 2017, which (if you ask me) largely undermines the carefully built retro feel up to that point.",2024-10-15
568,bercinerol,A Gripping New Chapter in the Franchise,9,"Alien Romulus takes the iconic sci-fi franchise to new heights with its compelling storytelling, intense action sequences, and hauntingly atmospheric visuals. The film successfully balances the tension and horror that fans expect while introducing fresh characters and a deeper exploration of the Alien universe. The performances are solid, particularly from the lead cast, and the pacing keeps viewers on the edge of their seats from start to finish.The special effects are top-notch, with the alien creatures looking as menacing as ever, and the setting of Romulus, a distant and mysterious planet, feels both immersive and terrifying. The film also does an excellent job of blending elements of psychological suspense with explosive action, making it a must-see for fans of the genre.However, one aspect that may pull viewers out of the experience is a particular scene involving an android character, where the technology and behavior feel a bit too unrealistic, even for a futuristic setting. While it's a minor issue in an otherwise stellar movie, it does momentarily break the suspension of disbelief.Overall, Alien Romulus is an exhilarating addition to the series, offering a gripping narrative and plenty of thrills, despite a few moments of questionable logic.",2024-10-18

Their new ideas didn't work, the new cast didn't work, and it seemed like the franchise will end in a terrible state.Alien: Romulus , despite having been made in the 2020s, which seems like the decade of bad sequels, was an acceptable addition to the franchise. It had elements of every good Alien movie, and a few new ideas, which weren't that good, but not too bad either.The story starts out great. Some of the scenes and the CGI works are really amazing. And the actors did a great job.I do hope this will be a new beginning for the franchise, and they will go on to make more and better movies.",2024-11-20

571,ScorpioDog,Entertaining!,7,"'Alien: Romulus' is a very entertaining watch, but there are a few areas within that could have been improved upon.David Jonsson gives my favourite performance, as he captures the complex android character perfectly. He has some interesting character dynamics with the rest of the crew. I also thought that Caliee Spaeny did a good job as the many protagonist.I found the use of AI in this to be quite poor and unnecessary. It is incredibly obvious where in the film it is used, and is a very strange choice for a practical heavy production. Furthermore, the film calls back to the original quite a lot through certain dialogue choices. This came off a little silly in my opinion, as there was no in-universe reason as to why the new characters would say the exact same sentences as previous characters in the franchise did.There were some great lighting and cinematography choices made in this! You really get to see some of the phenomenally creative production and set design pieces. I just wish the editing was more creative to emphasise these other fantastic filmmaking elements.Check this out if you are a fan of the 'Alien' franchise, as it has a lot to offer both newcomers and longtime fans!",2024-09-14

You have greatest monster and just use that we dont get xenomorphs in alien movies and why? There was pulse rifle action and we love it but just more that stuff becous the action scenes and xenomorphs all we need it but when we get shooting and turn it on it almost collabset. Maybe im wrong but if we just think hard that this movie was good alien movie but turn out be the thing what we hate. Those things are in prometheus and covenant and by the end in this movie too.

573,chand-suhas,Rain is the new Ripley in making.,7,"Rain Carradine's dream is to move to planet Yvaga and she is crushed when her permit is extended to another 5 to 6 years working in the mines while the colony is suffering with new diseases. She is stuck with her brother Andy, who is a synthetic human her father had fixed. Her ex Tyler and his gang, offer her to join them on a mission to steal cryostasis chambers from a derelict spaceship without knowing the spaceship to be the wrecked Nostromo. The bunch gets attacked by the facehuggers and soon the chestbuster unleashes itself. With time running out for the spaceship to crash into the planetary rings, the surviving ones must try to escape while Andy's primary directive is altered. Will they survive or will the company win in the end, forms rest of the story.Set in the time before the Aliens, the film offers all the fun associated with the franchise in right doses and while the human characters as well as their choices are as dumb as it can get, the build up to the creature and the subsequent mayhem makes up for it big time. For the most part, the screenplay is predictable and the xenomorphs are conveniently slower. I definitely did not buy into Rain and Andy's sibling sentiment as it gets stretched too far. But again, the highlight sequences involving the aliens was worth the IMAX watch. I am going with a lenient rating only because I never expected it to be this much fun whereas Alien and Aliens remain far superior which I never expected this film to match. Thankfully the makers too do not aim that high.",2024-08-23
574,jack_o_hasanov_imdb,Alienus : Romulus,7,"I watched ""Alien Romulus"" in the cinema long after its initial release, and I'm glad I finally did. I watched the movie in the Screen X hall, but it didn't make much of a difference for me, nor did it enhance the experience of the film. Regarding the film, I can say that I had heard a lot about Fede Alvarez, but I had never watched his movies before; I even confused him with another director. However, I was truly impressed by the film's cinematography and atmosphere; great work has been done. I was pleased to see the use of prosthetic makeup and practical effects, which made the film feel more convincing.To be honest, I found the beginning of the film a bit boring, and perhaps because I was tired, I even felt sleepy. I don't know why. But from the middle of the movie, specifically after the creatures were introduced, the film became much more engaging. Kudos to Fede Alvarez; he did a great job. I had some difficulty understanding certain scenes in the beginning, which slightly lowered my overall rating, but this film is still excellent.I appreciated the director's statement that a sequel might come, but he's not in a rush, emphasizing the need for a better story. It shows his commitment to the quality of the film. I didn't recognize any of the actors in the cast, but their performances were decent and didn't detract from the overall experience.",2024-09-10
575,MajorBaleegh,Dark and Cheesy,6,"Last night I with my wife went to see the movie ""Alien Romulus"". The film had lots of flaws. One for example no experienced actor was selected in the movie so all young kids were there as actors who failed in acting miserably. The alien the main theme of the movie came very late. In probably the second half of the movie there was some action concerning aliens where as if we see the other movies of the same title there were a lot of action and gore but that thing lacked in this film. Apart for watching in cinema with high-definition sound it felt good with loud noises otherwise the action part was very less in the movie. I enjoyed the caramel pops with lemon ice tea twice while watching the movie and tired to enjoy the movie with it but there was something missing.The fight scene is very short lived and was hardly of five minutes out of a movie of almost one twenty minutes. It was all the time quite dark and cheesy and not a good storyline. Teenagers tried to get hold of a ship I mean in such a controlled environment where there were so many guards and all that how they manage to escape the facility and wanted to hijack a spaceship seems quite out of the proportion.Had there been a senior and experienced actors that movie would be a great success, in my eyes this movie hardly takes 6 out of 10, I was expecting much more but I came back not satisfied.",2024-08-29
576,cescobedo325,Nice and refreshing,10,"So, I was excited when I saw the first teaser, but really didn't want it to follow in the footsteps of the previous two ""Alien"" iterations. This, however, was a pleasant surprise that was reminiscent of Ripley's tribulations. Plenty of darkened corridors to get your adrenaline pumping and just enough character buildup to give you someone to root for (for me it was a synthetic). The third act was unexpected and visceral but really great. Just when I thought it was going to end it just kept on pushing forward. If there was one flaw I would say the CGI for a certain character could have been better, but this wasn't that big of a deal. Definitely loved this movie and will look forward to watching it again.",2024-08-17
577,nxwpgxth,A decent effort if you love the franchise.,7,"The sets and the ambiance are fantastic. Even the music and all of the little cinematic beats seem like an extension of the first two films. Yet somehow it just doesn't do it for me. I feel like I'm watching the J. J. Abrahams version of Aliens where the technical aspects and little nods to nostalgia are there, but the story and characters didn't carry it for me. They have this slow buildup as the crew are escaping their mining community for greener pasture on another planet, but we know eventually there are going to be aliens, so there is just zero suspense because you can guess to a tee every plot beat. It's missing all of those little plot details like Newt in the second movie, or the politics of the crew interacting with Paul Reiser as the evil corporate guy, and Ripley fitting in with the crew as she loads crates. Without these I feel like I'm just watching filler until the Aliens finally appear, and by the time they arrive I couldn't care less.",2024-11-01

Then comes a haunted house movie, followed by some kind of action thriller. There's also a bolted-on ending, which is most likely resulting from reshoots. While the movie looks pretty good (a spectacle to behold for a good 17 minutes or so), the editing is sloppy, the characters clichéd, and the resulting movie is a committee-based compromise. This film would have been decent as a brain-dead, time-wasting activity on Hulu. As a blockbuster-wannabe intended to recharge the Alien franchise, it's deeply disappointing.",2024-08-17
579,rottentowers-63027,"Better than expected, a lot less than it could have been",7,"One wonders if the people who make these late-stage revivals will ever learn why such franchises as Aliens or The Terminator had so much money thrown at them decades ago. The funny thing is, although name recognition is a factor, it is not as big a factor as people think. The people who first saw the trailer for Aliens in 1986 and knew of the film Alien thought they would see similar levels of quality. The same expectation occurred between the first two Terminator films. But the cold, hard reality is that what brought most of the audience to Terminator 2 or Aliens was the quality of the new film. Word spread that Aliens was like having a series of progressively more violent panic attacks, and Terminator 2 was like watching the unstoppable force meeting the immovable object.And the people advertising the two stories spared no effort to reinforce these metaphors. But you cannot tell a potential audience that they are going to feel like they have been riding a bullet through a forest of angry carnivorous birds unless you have deliberately engineered your story to feel that way. And therein lies the problem. Alien: Romulus suffers from the same problem that every other Alien film other than the third has, in that it does not seem to know what it wants us to feel.If I could sum up the problem in one word, it would be inconsistency. For the first two thirds of the film, we are in a slow exploration of the Human social ills that drive the two masterpieces of the series. But the layer added in Romulus is only partial, and does not give a solid basis for the story to work on. When we are told that the company has just added howevermany years to our hero's contract, we are rolling our eyes in incredulity because this is completely unnecessary. So her contract ends and she is no longer forced legally to work for the company. What is she going to do? Work at McDonald's? The James Cameron of 1986 would, were he here today, concoct a clever story that illustrates how having no alternatives is as good as a binding contract. Once he got over his disappointment in his future self.The motivation, in spite of the poor setup, is solid. The losers of the story want to travel somewhere far away and figure they will just steal the necessary means from a derelict floating in orbit. Problem is, why is nobody securing the derelict? Yeah, space is big and there are only so many resources, but a project as major as the one uncovered would attract far more interest than none at all. Especially given the radical implications for deep space exploration. A project like this would be guarded tooth and nail by Weyland-Yutani. But our losers just find it floating in orbit around the planet they are condemned to slowly die on.Some interesting twists on old elements of the Alien series are offered. A little more thought is given to the sensory perception of the Facehugger, and that Alien-Human hybrid idea that Joss Whedon made so laughable is at least executed in a manner worthy of a ""good, not great"" from a discerning lover of science fiction, Warhammer, and so on.Everything before the word but is just a song, so here it goes. When all of the pieces that were lined up on the board are moved through the game, it all comes apart. The actions of the corporation make no sense, the behaviours of the hero group make sense up to a point, an opportunity for a truly unique plot point goes begging, and the callback to the series' highest point is dulled by one of the silliest instances of overestimating how much ammunition a rifle than can be carried by Human hands will hold. But at least this time, the writer(s) and director understand what made the good Alien films good.Filmento got my hopes up, but they were not totally vanquished by this film. Not this time. Take that for what it is worth.",2024-11-14

About 90 minutes. The characters aren't expendable cannon fodder and you really get to care for most of them. What both elevates and hinders the movie is that it's essentially fan service (which kind of keeps it from feeling like a wholly original film)and the director does a great job of bringing subtle and not so
Subtle winks to and elements of Alien, Aliens, Resurrection and Prometheus. Unfortunately, it's the elements of the latter two that kind of took the wind out of the sails for me. I'm not going to

584,StarWarsMoviesSuck,Thankful removal of the Prometheus arc,7,"The movie has issues, yes, but considering what the franchise turned into, it's a welcome return to the meat and potatoes of what makes the Alien franchise good to begin with.I give full credit to Fede for giving a nod and wink to everything in the franchise thus far, while providing something solid to build on.Honestly, given the initial setup for the movie, the world built could go away from Xenomorphs altogether and go toward an Outland type of storyline. Outland with androids and maybe even replicants. Or maybe the Thing? Dead Space? Interstellar Resident Evil?So yeah, the setup is great - we are provided the mining colony which is presented very well, good space travel and ship exploration sequences, followed by xenomorphs and bad androids and genetically dysmorphic terror stuff, and acid blood and automated gun turrets and anything scrappable from the 6 alien movies that Fede could stuff in.The actors do alright I think - it's probably hard to establish identities as young actors today, but the leads garner sympathy.In conclusion, I will just repeat that the setup and worldbuilding for this movie is absolutely top-notch in my opinion. The mining colony filled with lost and drifting souls a la Sorcerer, with enterprising people seizing the opportunity to go renegade and punch their ticket out of the solar system is totally brilliant, and the accompanying mood that Fede establishes is really good and promising. Let Fede continue to cook with the Alien franchise.",2024-10-24
585,affinitymusic,Overhyped return to the alien universe,5,"""Alien Romulus"" succeeds in creating a suspenseful and intriguing atmosphere, with a notable buildup that captures the essence of the original ""Alien"" films. The film attempts to reignite the franchise by paying homage to the classic elements of the first movie, including familiar settings and callbacks that evoke nostalgia for longtime fans. However, despite these efforts to connect with the franchise's roots, the film ultimately falls short.While the buildup is promising, the characters lack the depth and development needed to make their struggles compelling. They fail to engage the audience on an emotional level and I just didn't have the level of care for the characters as I did with the first films in the series.The plot, which starts off with a strong premise, becomes increasingly underwhelming as it progresses. The story fails to develop beyond a series of familiar beats, culminating in a third act that feels rushed and unsatisfying. The film's attempt to recreate the tension and excitement of the original ""Alien"" is overshadowed by a lack of substantial narrative and a predictable outcome.Ultimately, ""Alien Romulus"" feels more like a cash grab than a genuine effort to reinvigorate the franchise. While it offers some nods to the classic film, it lacks the innovation and depth needed to make it a worthy addition to the series.

Feels like it is set just after the original Alien and suits the story well.Lots of action which is great and the face huggers and Aliens look great. There are some times when the puppetry face huggers look like a child's toy but in general I like the fact it's not all CGI.Story is ok but a few holes in it where you find yourself asking questions.There is a good link to the original Alien that Happens early in the film but there after this there are to many nods to the previous films.

After ""Alien Three"", ""Alien Resurrection"", ""Alien versus Predator"", ""Aliens versus Predator Requiem"", ""Prometheus"", and ""Alien Covenant"".For my money this is the best Alien movie since the second one. The director this time is Fede Alvarez and he does a great job creating a stand alone Alien movie that also pays tribute to the previous films.The actors are all very good especially Cailee Spaeny and David Jonsson. Cailee Spaeny as the main character is so good she deserves to be considered for best actress at next year's Oscars.The film is very well made with great production design and visual effects. The quality of the sound is excellent with an outstanding music score. The cinematography and editing are also very good.This is definitely one of the best movies of the year. I had a great time seeing this movie in a movie theater. I recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the first two Alien movies.",2024-08-16
589,leoolimac,"We've seen it before, but it's a good add to the franchise!",6,"The plot is pretty simple, some teenagers are exploring the wreckage of a ship (the one from the classic first movie), and everything is going fine, until they meet the facehugger alien, and we all know what happens next.Obviously, something happens and they get stuck on the ship while they try to survive and return home.But, I must admit, the CGI is great, the creatures and scenarios are well-made, the gore scenes are realistic. The film is looking excellent, we have that classic mix of disgusting and scary.We also have some good action. A little cliché, but good, I really got immersed in the movie.This movie doesn't add anything new to the franchise or the genre, it's a well done side story with thing we've seen it before. But it's a fun movie overall, faithful to the original.",2024-10-21
590,calumstanley,Faithful To Original,9,"Watched this after rewatching the first two Alien films and have to say I was pleasantly surprised. After finding both covenant and Prometheus somewhat lacking, (despite having some really interesting lore) and finding Alien 3 and resurrection to have a very different vibe to the original movie, I wasn't expecting much out of this film.I find that this returns to the vibe of the very first Alien film. Strong action scenes, high stakes tension and very interesting world building that incorporates elements from all other movies and even the Alien Isolation game.Its very clear that amakers behind this films production clearly know and respect the source material.While not necessarily expanding the lore by a considerable amount, it's still very much a story worth watching.",2024-10-29

Overall a great review.I can see a difference between the original and this, when it comes to modernization, mostly through the characters, if you know what I mean, you know.Overall the movie is amazing, the start was a bit slow, but it's mostly because of a new crew that needs to be introduced, the start would be like a seven or an eight, but the whole movie gets the ten that it deserves.Really good movie, worth watching in theaters or on through streaming.",2024-09-24
592,mkennedy83,Sleek Visuals capture Folk Too Stupid to Live,6,"9th Alien film means we've already covered most of the grounds here. Lore changes and new action ideas are about the only offerings. I like the technical movie here, but the very same film seems to marginally hate it's characters. Fede felt similarly cruel with his cast in 'Don't Breathe' and 'Evil Dead'. If that's appeal, it's lost on me.The visuals of the first act and the tensions of the last act make for strong content. David Jonsson is a tour de force - 100% the best aspect. Puppets are killer. Final Boss is not perfect but still nightmare fuel.Theres no new plot in this 9th film, mirroring the core of 1, 3, and Prometheus. Any interesting character development is literally killed off before making an impact. The audience is following around mush mouthed losers waiting for their turn to die. I lost count of survivors that choose to stick around or stare directly at what is clearly going to kill them.I only want that level of stupid in Horror with Ducker & Dale, where in world explanations exist for such idiotic decision making. Other than all being suckered into a lifetime of servitude, I can't fathom why the team in this story chose to come together. The plot forces their decisions, moment after moment, until 'There's something in the water!' and plot no longer matters.Butt hurt by this, but still would recommend for Alien fans.",2024-08-30
593,gnperuti,Nice to see the series FINALLY back to form,9,"Alien Romulus is easily the best film in the series since Aliens. Granted, that really isn't saying much; the only films since then that have even been watchable are Alien vs Predator and Prometheus, while the rest sucked. But somehow, they finally managed to get their act together with this one. Part of that may be the fact that they went back to basics here, with a small cast and low stakes. The most interesting part is easily the opening, where we actually get to see one of the colonies the crew from the first film would have gone to, seeing how it works and operates and how the Company treats its workers is cool stuff. Once we go into space, it takes a while to get going, like the original, but once it starts, it's nonstop terror. The film combines the claustrophobic atmosphere of Alien with the high octane action of Aliens, which match perfectly and lead to some truly intense scenes throughout. There are quite a few references to the previous films, mainly in the second half, and while some of them are decent, most are sadly pretty groan worthy.The acting isn't spectacular, nor are the characters, but they are likeable enough, except the character of Bjorn, but he actually has a good reason to behave the way he does. The most interesting character by far is Andy, which isn't surprising, seeing as how the android characters are usually the most memorable in these films. When it begins, he's really faulty and messed up, with limited vocabulary to boot, but once he receives an upgrade, he becomes more intelligent and goes through a pretty unnerving arc where he actually turns on the crew thanks to the programming in the upgrade. He also has good chemistry with the lead and a tendency to make dad jokes, providing an amusing running gag. I know a lot of people didn't like Ian Holm being recreated, but honestly, while it does feel a bit gimmicky, it kind of makes sense in context; why wouldn't there be another model like Ash?The effects and art direction are both among the series' best. The digital recreation of Holm's face shows just how far this gimmick has come since the days of Rogue One and Tron Legacy. The same goes for the aliens; we've come a long way from the silly movement of the monster in the first film. The ship and space station where the majority of the film takes place both look great. The latter in particular is massive, sprawling, and filled with tons of cool/creepy rooms. The kills and gore effects are as juicy as ever. And the music is some of the series' best; during some of the really intense scenes, it's like a rapidly beating heart, appropriate, since that's exactly what mine was doing.Overall, Alien Romulus is a huge return to form for the series. I'm really ashamed that I didn't see it in theaters. I mean, I sat through freaking Alien Covenant, so there isn't much excuse. Oh well, I'll definitely be checking out the next one, provided it's a direct sequel.",2024-11-22
594,violetfisher-62038,A New Chapter in the Alien Franchise,7,"Walking into ""Alien: Romulus,"" I was filled with a mix of excitement and trepidation. As a long-time fan of the franchise, I hoped for a return to the gripping tension and atmospheric horror that defined the original films. What I experienced was a cinematic ride that oscillated between nostalgia and frustration.The film opens with a palpable sense of dread, immediately transporting you to the gritty, industrial aesthetic reminiscent of the 1979 classic. The set design is a love letter to the retro-futuristic style that fans adore, and the practical effects are a refreshing departure from the over-reliance on CGI that has plagued many modern blockbusters. The Xenomorphs, in all their terrifying glory, are beautifully realized, and the sound design-complete with familiar echoes from past films-had me on edge.However, as the plot unfolded, I found myself grappling with a sense of déjà vu. The storyline felt like a patchwork of borrowed elements from previous entries in the series, lacking the originality that could have propelled it into new territory. While I appreciated the nods to the franchise's history, there were moments where it felt more like a checklist of fan service than a cohesive narrative. The dialogue often felt recycled, and I found myself wincing at some of the attempts to invoke iconic lines from earlier films. It was as if the script was trying too hard to remind us of what we loved, rather than forging its own identity.The performances were a mixed bag. The lead actress brought a strong presence to her role, carrying the emotional weight of the story, but the supporting cast felt underdeveloped and forgettable. There were moments where I wished the film had taken more time to flesh out the characters, as their motivations often felt thin and clichéd.One of the film's strengths was its ability to create tension through atmospheric elements, utilizing temperature and gravity in ways that felt innovative within the franchise. The jump scares, which I typically find overused, were executed well and genuinely startled me at times. Yet, even these moments of thrill were overshadowed by the overarching feeling that the story was treading familiar ground without offering anything new.As the credits rolled, I was left with a bittersweet taste. ""Alien: Romulus"" is undoubtedly a visual spectacle and a treat for die-hard fans, but it struggles under the weight of its own nostalgia. While it successfully captures the essence of what made the original films great, it ultimately feels like.",2024-11-11
595,euggzxh,Nice return to the original genre,7,"While it was really good to see a return to the original genre, (sci fi horror), I felt the acting performances , with the exception of Andy, was pedestrian at best. Consider the performances in this film up against the likes of Bill Paxton, Sigourney Weaver, Paul Riser, Ron Perlman and Michael Fasbender . On the plus side, the special effects were outstanding and the storyline was well developed and has further development scope for future additions. Overall I enjoyed the film albeit next time I would spend a little more dough on the cast . Next time , think about calling Daisy Edgar Jones, Jenna Ortega or. Anya Taylor-Joy for the lead. I am pretty sure Jenna could play both heroine and Alien if push came to shove.",2024-09-01
596,macperreo,My favorite installment of the franchise,9,"I was trying not to get my hopes too high for this film, because I had them extremely high when ""Covenant"" came out and I didn't like it that much, but this film definitely exceeded my expectations.I loved the pacing, I loved the music, I loved the attention to detail and the great effort they put into making all the costume and production design, props etc. Look like the first 2 movies, (since this one takes place between those 2), unlike ""Prometheus"", which by the way, was my favorite installment until today and which even though is a prequel that takes place like 30 years BEFORE the first ""Alien"", everything in it, makes it look like it takes place hundreds of years after the first one. I loved that the characters felt like real people with whom you can relate and empathize and actually understand the reason why they embark on this deadly mission. But most of all, I loved the acting, specially Cailee Spaney's performance. This is the 3rd production in which I see her, and her acting just feels so honest, genuine and natural. I just believe every emotion she's transmitting and she makes any situation seem believable.The only negative thing about the film for me, is the fact that it's a prequel. I wish they had just made a continuation of the franchise as Sigourney Weaver left it, rather than a prequel. I wish they had done with it what it's being done with the ""Scream"" franchise, in which they're continuing the story with new characters but still keeping the tone and much of the original material. Where does this endless need for prequels and prequels of sequels and origin stories come from? I just don't get it. And the fact that this story takes place before ""Aliens"", keeps me from giving it a 10, because, even though I loved the entire thing and its ending, knowing that what comes after it is my least movie of the entire franchise and possibly one of my most hated movies of all time, kind of takes the fun out of it. But it's definitely in my list of favorite movies of this year, I would definitely recommend it and absolutely watch it again.",2024-08-15

The music, production quality, tons of easter eggs paying homage to the original first 2.... so good! This one falls in line after Alien, but before Aliens. Where it fell flat was in character development. You don't really care about any of them other than the android. Therefore, you're not invested if they really live or die. Then, the last 30 minutes... they went for shock value, but it just seemed like it didn't cohesive. It's like they all of a sudden changed the plot. It doesn't fit with the others either.

599,aaliyahoneil,Out of This World Terror,9,"Alien: Romulus, directed by Fede Álvarez, is a thrilling and tense addition to the Alien franchise, taking the horror back to its roots with a fresh yet familiar approach. Set in the same universe as the original films, Romulus follows a group of colonists who, after landing on a remote and uncharted planet, find themselves in a battle for survival against the terrifying xenomorphs. Álvarez expertly blends the atmospheric dread of the earlier films with high-stakes action and suspense, creating a film that both respects the legacy of the franchise and brings new life to it.The cast, led by Cailee Spaeny as the resilient protagonist Rain, delivers strong performances across the board. Spaeny's portrayal of a woman struggling with both her own personal demons and the terror of an alien invasion adds emotional depth to the film. Her character's growth, from someone unsure of her survival instincts to a fearless leader, anchors the narrative. The supporting cast, including David Jonsson and Isabela Merced, adds layers to the group dynamic, creating believable relationships that heighten the emotional stakes as they face the horrific creatures.Álvarez's direction is both visually stunning and deeply unsettling. The use of isolated, dark environments and stark lighting enhances the feeling of helplessness and fear as the characters are forced to confront the deadly xenomorphs in confined spaces. The tension is maintained throughout, with Álvarez taking his time to build suspense before unleashing the terror. The xenomorphs themselves are presented with a modernised yet faithful look, maintaining the same terrifying quality that made them such an iconic part of the franchise.The film's pacing is tight, with enough action to keep the audience engaged without losing the sense of isolation and fear. The horror in Romulus is not just about the xenomorphs; it's about the psychological toll that the situation takes on the characters as they struggle with trust, survival, and the haunting unknown. While Alien: Romulus provides plenty of thrilling moments and shocking sequences, it also explores deeper themes such as the cost of human ambition and the perils of colonisation.However, the film is not without its flaws. While Romulus does much to reintroduce the series' horror elements, it occasionally feels like it is retreading familiar ground from the earlier films, especially in terms of plot structure. The tension built up in the earlier parts of the film is occasionally undermined by moments that feel too derivative, leading to some predictable sequences. Additionally, some viewers might feel that the character development is sacrificed for the sake of the action, leaving a few of the supporting characters underdeveloped.In conclusion, Alien: Romulus is a gripping, atmospheric, and thrilling film that successfully captures the essence of the Alien franchise while introducing fresh, new elements. With strong performances, a gripping storyline, and moments of pure horror, Romulus stands as a worthy addition to the series, even if it doesn't quite push the envelope in terms of originality. Fans of the franchise will find much to love, and the film serves as a powerful reminder of why the Alien universe remains one of the most terrifying in cinema.",2024-11-13
600,moviesfilmsreviewsinc,The acting was phenomenal,10,"Alien: Romulus is a sequel to the popular Alien franchise, set between 1979's Alien and 1986's Aliens. The film follows Rain Carradine, a young girl from Earth who dreams of the sunshine above Jackson's Star Mining Colony. She seeks refuge with Andy, an android programmed by her late father to protect her and tell jokes. Andy faces discrimination from the locals, but Rain views him as her ""brother,"" replacing the mother-child undercurrents in previous Alien films. Although the film primarily focuses on the loyalty and affection between brothers and sisters, it also includes birth- and sex-related imagery, including a late abortion sequence. Rain's travel visa is revoked and her work contract is extended by five years. However, she finds solace in visiting Tyler, his cousin Bjorn, sister Kay, and friend Navarro. Tyler, tired of their conscription in Weyland-Yutani's intergalactic expansion, finds a way to escape the dreary planet with Andy's help. They plan to use the derelict ship's cabins and cryo-sleep chambers for a voyage to the bright and sunny world of Yvaga III. Alien: Romulus hits theaters on August 16, proving that there is still plenty of acid-bloody life left in the franchise's monstrous bones. In this sci-fi film, Álvarez and Sayagues create a space-seen tale with a heavy, rusty, and wet technology that evokes a sci-fi reality. The film features a decommissioned ship, a giant research and development outpost, where Rain and her friends are introduced to H. R. Giger-imagined xenomorphs. The film's main purpose is to study these creatures, who have fatal blood and slimy tongues. The film's opening and disorienting scenes include vast panoramas of tiny pods flying above fantastical worlds, floating and rotating camerawork, and a Benjamin Wallfisch score that harkens back to Jerry Goldsmith's musical themes. The film's ominous mood is set by the weightiness of the technology and the dreadful introduction of the H. R. Giger-imagined creatures. Alien: Romulus is a sci-fi film directed by Álvarez and Sayagues, featuring a unique twist in the story. The film begins with a cryo chamber trip that releases numerous xenomorph face-huggers, leading to Rain replacing David's brain module with that of a ""dead"" android. The 'bot from which Andy receives his new module has the face of Ian Holm, who played the nefarious android Ash in Scott's Alien. This artificial intelligence is intent on retrieving a xenomorph for profit-making purposes, enlisting Andy, who becomes torn between his allegiance to his corporate maker and Rain. The script trades in customary ideas about life, love, and evolution, while also acknowledging the story that came before it. While contextualizing the film within the larger series may feel clunky, the film's primary directive is to wring horror out of a tried-and-true formula. Álvarez repeatedly devises creative methods of putting men and women in peril with the xenomorph, such as scenes involving the sudden disappearance of gravity or a finale centered around Kay's secret pregnancy. Alien: Romulus doesn't quite do justice to its signature baddie, but its CGI is excellent and its set design is impressive. It subtly tips its cap to Scott's underrated prequels Prometheus and Alien: Covenant, with which it shares an abiding fascination with androids, embodied by Jonsson. Despite its somewhat limited ambition, Alien: Romulus gets its scream-worthy job done, and in its homage-y closing notes, it suggests a promisingly perilous path forward.",2024-08-22
601,yugesh-karnati,MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU XENOMORPH,8,"To start with I'm a big fan of Alien franchise (barring the AVP series) and I've been waiting to watch this since they've announced it. At the beginning I was disappointed that Ridley's no more the director of this but when I got to know that Fede's the one who's going to direct this I was more than happy! Cuz like Mike & Wan I'd say that he's a modern horror master (but I'm still disappointed that Ridley didn't get to complete his prequel trilogy).Coming to the movie, it's a beautifully crafted space horror movie since Prometheus (I know some doesn't agree with me on this but IMO, Prometheus is one of the greatest space horror movies ever made and could've been a cult classic if not for all those studio cuts which we later got to watch them all in the Blu-ray released version, but it's an altogether different debate) paying homages to Alien, Aliens and Alien-Isolation. It follows the same pattern as Alien but the way Fede tied the Prometheus & Covenant's story arcs, closing some of those loop holes, fills up your heart with joy and excitement!And what a great performance by David as Andy, the switch to synthetic android was awesome! Cailee too gave a wonderful performance as Rain, I guess I'd rank her at second position among the list of survivors in the whole Alien franchise after Ripley but place her at 3rd when individual Alien movie is taken into account after Ripley & Elizabeth Shaw. The chemistry between Rain and Andy is the heart of the film creating many interesting moments of drama. I personally wanted to see Tyler survive till the end and kill at least 1 Alien given his knowledge on combat skills but unfortunately didn't get to do that in the end. Unlike Covenant, the third and the final act really took me by surprise and was executed really well.With great cinematography, tense suspenseful atmosphere and great visuals this is an absolute treat to the fans of Alien franchise. And to top that, my heart was filled up to the brim when I heard the sound of that pulse rifle on big screen Dolby Atmos when Rain fired it, it was a pure joy and music to my ears, it's like listening to one of those Mozart/Beethoven's symphonies. By the time the end credits roll, you'll be satisfied with most of the answers that were presented. A must watch for all the fans of horror genre and Alien franchise.",2024-09-15

Read many of the reviews, some give it nines and tens, i mean they must be school kids.Do yourself a favor and don't waste two hours of your life watching this. But the worst thing is not that the movie is garbage. I feel this is the end, they buried Alien series too. They buried Star Wars and so many others, it was expected to happen once more.

The directing and pacing are very decent for the rather simple plot (as should be the case for an Alien movie), and the actors are doing a good job even if these are not out-of-this-world performances.

The film brings together elements from Interstellar (the space), Dune (the world building), and A Quiet Place (the monsters) to create a captivating narrative that will surely resonate with viewers. The acting is admirable, particularly the undeniable chemistry between Andy and Rain, which adds depth to their interactions. The OST stands out as unique and commendable.While there are disturbing moments that contribute to the tension, the ending is a bit disappointing, lacking an epilogue that could have provided closure. Although the writing might not be the film's strongest aspect, it's undeniable that this film is a visual masterpiece.

605,j-madej,"Alvarez and his team crafted something very special, which potentially can reanimate a franchise giving it tasteful breath of fresh air.",9,"If you are a fan of 'ALIEN' franchise, imagine instance, where all the best parts you've loved about this saga are melted in to one movie...Original 'ALIEN' from 1979 horror classic with it sense of claustrophobic isolation and fantastic H. R. Giger design, 'ALIENS' 1986 with its full on war against multiple creatures, 'ALIEN 3' with maze tracking chaise scenes, and finally 'ALIEN: Resurrection 1997, with its underwater weightless sequences and a new creature design, which is a hybrid of human and alien DNA. Throw a little mythology of 'Prometheus' 2012 and what you get it's nearly perfect fan friendly thrill ride, which will leave you wanting more.Originally 'ALIEN: Romulus' was set to premiere on streaming service Hulu, but just before the shooting began it was upgraded to theatrical release.On a humble budget of $80 mil (which is very little for todays Hollywood standards) shot in Budapest, Hungary, the production design and art design alone are brilliantly crafted making each and every location, interior and exterior looking stunning.This part is clearly tilted towards the younger demographic, as all characters in the movie are in their 20's. Although the initial synopses feels very basic, as I mentioned before, it gives opportunities to explore parts of previous movies, which worked the best narratively and in terms of visual storytelling.'While scavenging the deep ends of a derelict space station, a group of young space colonists come face to face with the most terrifying life form in the universe.'It must be mentioned that the title of the movie gives certain felling of a new beginning. As mythological story of Romulus and Romus (the creators of Rome and Roman Empire, which as we popularly know transformed in to Roman Catholic (universal) Church, has more depth then originally meets the eye, having something to do with DNA modification in human kind.Director Fede Alvarez who also co-wrote the script knows very well how to craft suspense and sense of dread.Because in the past he showcased very good taste in his previous movies, he did not disappoint, with how the story progresses, keeping the audience engaged at all times. You can also see a hand of director Ridley Scott, which mentored this project as a producer, giving the notes to Fede asking him to cut down the running time for better passing.The performances of all principals are very believable especially Cailee Spaeny as Rain, which tries to channel the original protagonist of the series and yet maintaining sense of fragility and strength, which makes the audiences follow her journey of empowerment. David Jonsson as her ""brother"" Andy dives into childlike sensibilities only to surprise us with his change. Very good performance indeed! Other supporting cast complement the narration very well, although using predominantly British actors for most roles, often can get little distracting in terms of their accents, as not everyone familiar with regional British accents, might understand all interactions, without dubble checking the subtitles, especially when they wearing helmets and their voices are bit unauditable.All the CGI in combination with practical Visual FX are brilliantly crafted, with one little exception of CGi rendition of character, which comes back from the past which is clearly not well executed. But despite that little mishap the actual visual and practical fx are really brilliantly crafted.It would be very easy to categorized 'ALIEN: Romulus' as just another fan film. Situated narratively 20 years after the original 'ALIEN' it's truly tries to invoke the grit and dread of the original installment, going as far as borrowing the title design from the original installment.Much more of a horror then all the other movies in a franchise' ALIEN: Romulus' wants to introduce a younger generation to wonderful world of the future started by Ridley Scott back in 1979.The biggest criticism could be that due to a mishap with CGI rendition of a past character, this film cannot be called perfect, but due to very good taste Fede Alvarez and his team crafted something very, very special, which potentially can reanimate a franchise giving it tasteful breath of fresh air, which to fans of original movies feels vary familiar indeed.Highly recommended!",2024-08-17
606,glacticness,Absolutely terrible,1,"I was apprehensive at the thought of Fede Alvarez directing the most beloved franchise of mine.Looking at his previous work, his notable contributions include Evil Dead 2013 and Don't Breathe. That's it folks. 2 mid-tier horror/suspense films. I say mid-tier because they were good films, but they aren't remotely at the quality of what Ridley Scott or James Cameron can do.Fede also did the Dragon Tattoo sequel where the main actress Rooney Mara was fired/replaced with a rather unlikable actress and the film bombed.He does not have a good track record and Romulus highlights that now more than ever before.James Cameron didn't need to do callbacks to the first film. He created something unique of its own because he's a creative talent.Fede Alvarez relied on one call back after the next because he doesn't have one original thought of his own.He also did his signature move of hiring all young teenager looking people for all the parts. The problem was that no one he cast was even likeable or memorable except the synthetic, Andy. I didn't care if all of them died to be honest!!!Stop hiring hiring him... seriously... he'll be the David Gordon Green of the Alien franchise if you let him. Don't let his hands on another Alien film. PERIOD.Bring Ridley back for a Covenant sequel. Those films had good characters (and great casting with recognizable people, and newer more unknown actors), complex story that was both philosophical and scientific. There was mystery, there was less action but there was certainly more gore when there was. The back-burster scene in Covenant tops anything Fede did in Romulus.",2024-08-20

Could have been VERY good, but two big flaws:1) An off-note performance by a CGI villian.2) Way too many obvious, gratuitous memberberries. The first couple were fine, after that they pulled you out of the narrative.I won't even talk about the writing, because I've come to accept that culture has changed and young writers find it necessary for characters to talk about their feelings and verbally support/encourage other characters. At this point, I'm simply happy when nobody says, ""You're the strongest person I know.""The film also serves as a cautionary tale of the danger of genetically combining Jennifer Lawrence and Ellen Page. The result will be far from Sigourney Weaver.",2024-09-18
608,wedel-02240,Aliens ... alive and kicking,8,"That worked very well and delivered exactly the right dose of dark science fiction, action, creepiness, and suspense that you would expect from a movie in the Alien series.The visuals, special effects, sound effects, overall look, and of course the aliens were top-notch, exactly as you would have hoped for.I found the movie extremely well-paced and appreciated the references to the previous movies, which provided just the right amount of nostalgia by taking some elements and integrating them into a new setting. These references were well-executed without feeling like they were forced in just for the sake of it.The action, in my opinion, was well-choreographed, and I didn't mind too much that some of the alien transformations stages seemed to happen a bit too quickly. For me ok to keep the story in pace and tension high.Alien: Romulus comes close enough to Ridley Scott's and Cameron's masterpieces, but no one would expect the seventh (?) movie of the franchise to outperform the legendary first two. It didn't deliver the big WOWs that only masterpieces can achieve, but it was still a more than solid delivery.",2024-08-17
609,djrmc24,One of the best in the Alien series!,9,"Alien: Romulus exceeded my expectations and I enjoyed it very much. This was the Alien movie that I have been waiting for. The scares were there and the action was top notch. It amazes me how much they were able to do here with such a low budget. The practical effects were amazing and looked very much real. This film also does a great job with connecting all of the other Alien movies together. What I really enjoyed here was how the cast was not supposed to be military trained and were just like your average young adults trying to make a living. There are some really awesome moments in this film where my jaw had dropped, especially during that zero gravity scene. Alien: Romulus is a perfect example of how you can make a great film with a lower budget. It gets a high 9 stars out of 10 from me.",2024-09-22
610,timonsoovik,Finally a good movie again for the Franchise,8,"I had little expectations but was positively surprised.For me its definitely the third best movie of the franchise, behind the first two of course.Never a dull moment, its always exciting.The majority of the CGI was top notch with one major exception, don't know how this went through final qualitry control.The whole technology in the movie reflects part 1 and 2, so we have old monitors with scan lines, lots of sound effects from the first movie, the airlocks etc. (Whereas in Prometheus and or Covenant the tech looked much more advanced than what it should have).Camerawork / Screenplay was nicely done, you could tell they tried to avoid having green screens as much as they could, which was nice to see.Alvarez didnt reinvent Alien, but overall it's definitely worth watching and in my opinion a worthy movie for the franchise again :)",2024-08-17
611,Jonas1969,Some Alien a lot Aliens but also a large dose Resurrection,7,The world building is strong but the characters are weak. The action is great but the fan service bits are terrible. What we get is a bit disjointed but still a mostly enjoyable movie.Romulus tries to connect story elements to the first Alien movie but does so in a very stupid way that will probably annoy most fans of the franchise. It's still better than when it tries to pay homage to Resurrection.. but maybe I'm a bit biased because I really detest that film.The characters are mostly forgettable but they do well with the action scenes - of which there are plenty.Taken as a whole it is still one of the better movies in the franchise though nowhere near as good as the first two.,2024-10-19

The ingenious use of gravity and temperature amazed me. Nothing much to say about dialogue and writing but it has stunning visuals and the use of practical effects by taking help of the original team from Alien (1979). For one moment, Caliey looked like a badass like Ripley from Aliens.Do the characters in this definitely look like a teen movie but Is still watchable and enjoyable.",2024-09-16

It's the first of many , what should we call them, ....thefts...from better, original movies.The new Alien Monster victims are younger than past movies. The plucky heroine never gets fully fleshed out. Her Dad died, leaving her to take care of the idiot synthetic who has the mental capacity of a sweet child. The conflicts between the characters seem forced and unrealistic.The young protagonists somehow steal a space craft from a planet where people are struggling to survive, yet no one goes after it. The young people all see to know how to run spaceships, bypass complex security systems, and dock their smaller stolen craft onto a larger vessel. They find slime, tunnels carved from acidic alien blood, and the halls of the larger vessel are filled with leaking water like it's just normal for a ship with complex electronics to have little streams running through them. All the Alien tropes are there. The only original addition is a new Alien design. It wasn't enough to justify an entire new entry into the series.The photography was good, special effects were up to standard and the actors weren't bad. The first two movies in the series were a 10. Alien: Romulus isn't bad. It just doesn't come close to the two originals.",2024-11-03

Alien and Aliens etc all happen in dark areas but you can see what's happening this suffers nearly as much as AvP Requiem for bad lighting
And the film is just call backs to past movies while ignoring the basics. Seemed to be more bothered with jump scares and gore than a good script. Impregnating a person and alien birth within minutes for example. An entire planet happens not to notice a large space station above its head apart from some kids?

615,derek-duerden,Must be Difficult Being Out-acted by a Dead Guy,7,"For context - I went to see Alien when it came out, at the then-largest screen in England (Odeon Leicester Square, if I remember correctly) with a bunch of colleagues, and we were all blown away. I lost track for a while, only seeing Aliens on DVD many years later (disappointing, over-hyped by Terminator-fuelled Cameron fanboys I thought) and I've still not seen Alien 3 or any of the others prior to Prometheus.For some reason - possibly the presence of Noomi Rapace - I decided to see Prometheus and really enjoyed it - good actors and acting, plus a cohesive story that extended the lore in (I thought) an interesting way. This naturally led me to view Covenant, and blimey was that a disappointment - no Noomi, terrible story and some really poor CGI.I'm really quite glad therefore that this is a return to the core storyline and somewhat-grungy effects that made the original so compelling. The story is however ""just OK"" even though the way that the tension ratchets and the scares develop is quite well-handled. The main issue for me was the apparent ""YA"" target of the whole cast and the lack of character in most of them. Was I watching ""Maze Runner"" rather than ""Firefly""?, I started to think... Indeed, as the backstory ""developed"" I was seriously considering leaving after about 25 minutes owing to lack of engagement with this teen crew.However, to give credit to Cailee and the director, I did gradually start to care about some of them - but not that much! I can't help feeling that, even with the same script (corny callbacks included) the whole thing would have been much more satisfying with more proper actors on board. They'd then be less likely to be out-acted by a guy who's been dead for 4 years!",2024-09-14

With a title of Romulus, surely this would be ripe with meaningful philosophising, clever script, thought provoking ideas?Well, not really, in fact not at all. From the get go when the fresh faced teenage protagonists are introduced, I got that sinking feeling of impending disappointment. Not to say there is no entertainment to be had, as there is. Its very well produced with solid feeling backdrops that feel real and solid, unlike the recent fashion for obvious and unconvincing green screen backdrops. The actors and script are convincing enough, there are some clever action sequences, its all very tangible.However, once you've seen one door closing, door not opening, door sticking sequence, you really do not need a couple of dozen more.Time to eject this increasingly vacuous franchise into the cold vacuum of space I think.",2024-10-20

I thought 2013's Evil Dead was a vile masterpiece in almost all of the right ways.This movie does plenty of things right. I like the atmosphere and the plot. Certain moments are fantastic and interesting and tense. To speak of what I liked would mean spoilers so...It also does a few things terribly wrong. Many callbacks felt like something a fan would yell from the audience; not actual dialog. They seemed forced by ""The Mouse"" so people could give their friend winking elbows. One actor's Brit-ish sounded like he was trying to talk with a mouthful of water; couldn't understand him. One turn towards the end was so foolish and poorly realized that it almost ruined what I liked about the whole film.",2024-09-21
619,michvanbeek,"Starts slow, but after 30 minutes buckle up!",9,"In 1979 we were shown Alien, an oppressive masterpiece by Ridley Scott, who also immediately launched his career. The film was an unprecedented success and to this day I have a classic of you there. What's even more special is that James Cameron's sequel Aliens beat the original. Perhaps a completely different film than its predecessor, but really one of the best science fiction horror- films in the history of the genre. In the 90s, Alien 3 and Alien: Resurrection followed and then it became quiet around the Xenomorph. Until 2012 and Scott took care of Prometheus highly personally and this was a pleasant surprise. Successor Alien Covenant unfortunately disappointed, but people were waiting for another movie. Rumors were circulating that Neil Blomkamp would make an Alien film in which Sigourney Weaver and Michael Biehn would return, but unfortunately the plug was pulled out of that project. Now Fede Alvarez comes up with a new Alien- film that takes place between Alien and Aliens. Alvarez has already proven several times that he is absolutely worthy of the horror film genre. With the remake of Evil Dead in his pocket and the fantastic Don't Breathe movies, Alvarez seems like the right man to revive the Alien movies.The film takes about thirty minutes to delve into the story of Rain and Andy and basically this is the part that people could fall over. The characters are rather superficial and the story is rather dull and boring. But when Rain arrives on the abandoned ship with her five companions, the gelazer soon begins and you end up in an absolute roller coaster ride. The roar of people that the story is not original or that we don't get to see anything new under the sun, I wonder: what did you expect from a franchise that has been building on the same concept since 1979. Incidentally, the story of Alien at the time did not excel in originality and that is not bad either. Alien: Romulus is set between Alien (1979) and Aliens (1986) and Alvarez lets this film match perfectly. He really grabs the atmosphere very well with the compelling and good soundtrack of the film, but perhaps even more by showing the ships and the equipment on board the ships in the 1979 way. We see video tube monitors that make sounds from the futuristic computer at the time, the camera images that are full of noise and much more that especially characterized the first two Alien- films. It ensures that the continuity remains present and that the film fits perfectly in that regard.Alvarez really gets the oppressive atmosphere very well. Well you can leave that to this director of course, just look at his films Don't Breathe and the remake of Evil Dead. In the tweet hour that the film lasts, you will sit on the cinema chair for an hour and a half with your buttocks pinched together. No, maybe the action is a repetition of moves, yet it is extremely effective. The director who also wrote the story also shows his own creativity in the story. For example, the scene where gravity falls away and the Alien blood flies through the air is really freezing. You have to see for yourself how this proceeds and what the reason is, but tension is guaranteed in any case. What is very cool is that the connection is also found with Prometheus (2012), something that actually makes the Alien universe completely complete and connects well. But don't let me give away or analyze too much for the rest, it is recommended to experience Alien: Romulus for yourself. If it goes through on this foot in this franchise, I can get them out of Scott's Prometheus series and make a few more films that match it.Alien: Romulus starts half an hour slow with a somewhat dull story, but then you have to fasten the belts of your cinema chair well. The film has become a real roller coaster ride, where as a viewer you will sometimes watch with pinched buttocks. Director Fede Alvarez lets this film perfectly match Alien and Aliens by taking over the atmosphere one by one and making the technology in the film the same as in the old films. For example, the screens are simply the familiar monitors that make the futuristic computer sounds at the time. The cameras that have to display what is happening in the oppressive corridors of the ship are also shown again with a lot of noise and falls away and that just makes it that Alien: Romulus connects perfectly. The Facehuggers and Aliens look fantastic and there are some fantastic other things in the movie that I don't want to reveal now. It is advisable to just go to the cinema and experience this movie. The fans will absolutely not be disappointed.",2024-08-24
620,athanasiosze,6.6/10. Borderline recommendable.,7,"Hype is not justified. This is slightly worse even than the COVENANT. And the COVENANT already was not a very good movie. I can see why it's a commercial success, there is a lot of action, action scenes are well directed and the whole second part of the movie is intense. But there's nothing more to it. Script is messy and chaotic. It's not well acted ( except the leading character). Actors are the opposite of charismatic, i could not even remember their faces. Not every actor should be beautiful or attractive of course, so many not good looking actors are great. But they had ""personality"". To be honest, i didn't even care about the fate of these characters. Not only the actors were not charismatic but even their characters were uninteresting and not well written.Still, i gave it a good rating because Alvarez knows how to make a good horror movie and as i said previously, at least Cailee Spaeny was good enough to carry this movie on her shoulders. Even her character was well developed. Overall, build up was good. It's a 2 hours movie but it never got boring, even though the charcters were. I can't say i was on the edge of my seat, but i appreciated it. 2024 is the worst cinematic year of all time, after 2021. At least, ROMULUS is watchable, at worst.",2024-11-11

Aliens could have been made better, so they have no idea to come up with something original, and the director has no idea how to make his film without using things from previous works.

622,saolivaresm,The return that the saga deserved with one of the best films of the year,8,"The mission was difficult, but Fede Álvarez once again demonstrates that he is one of the best directors currently working in the genre and delivers one of the great films of the year and once again places Alien in the spotlight as it deserved.The great virtue that Alien's return to the big screen offers is that it takes us back to the central spirit of the original. The saga comes back to life and does so at the hands of a director who does not try to discover anything new, but rather takes everything good about the original and updates it to provide a continuation in style, texture, photography and anguish as if it were 1979.It's fueled by a cast that's up to the task, with upcoming star Cailee Spaeny giving us a female lead with all the spirit of Lt. Ripley and her own nuances and style, but the young actress fills the screen at all times and shoulders the spotlight without a hitch. Complemented by a stunning David Jonsson and supporting actors who all shine in their respective places, Archie Renaux, Isabela Merced, Spike Fearn and Aileen Wu know how to convey the fear, desperation and anguish of being hunted by the Xenomorph we hate so much.The intelligence of its director in knowing how to adapt the world of Alien without ever losing the blood of the saga, but at the same time having its own identity with details and updates that make the saga enter into territory that it had not entered and that makes a pleasant impact when it comes to enjoying the proposal in all its dimension. It explores alternative paths that feel satisfactory and at the same time disturbing, which also involves the film feeling that it has a lot to explore and not showing that it is tired or exhausted, in that sense Fede Álvarez, comes out a winner and does so with the style of a great director.Terror is the essence of its director and, pleasantly, he does not leave aside suspense and tension, which stands out both in the visual aspect and in its critical background. It is effective, manages to move with considerable elegance and ingenuity through the well-tested terrain of the saga and provides some unexpected narrative twists.It has effective scares, unforgettable gore, and enough xenomorphs to fill the entire screen, and a lot of handcrafted feel. It's a film that feels like it was created with love and respect, and above all, dedication, which is excitingly appreciated whether you're a fan of the saga or not. The film is pure science fiction and there's no arguing that what its director is proposing is carefully calculated entertainment. It may have lower moments than others, but for the most part the film is completely even. Once you reach the point of no return, the plot doesn't stop and it sticks you to the screen with no way out.I'm left with one of the most satisfying films of 2024, which aims to pay homage to its original, combine the sensations of Isolation and present its own path forward, a perfect challenge that is fully achieved, demonstrating that ideas are not exhausted, you just have to know how to focus them to achieve satisfaction.",2024-10-16
623,iwf120586,Try not to be Too Cynical,9,"Hollywood obviously loves it's recipes and tries to stay safe but this is still a fun, serious and well made movie. I rolled my eyes a few times, but tried to find some great things and give it a fair enough rating. Maybe I would have given it an eight, but def not a seven or a ten.The first act opens with great world building, and a lot of the Weyland-Yutani trope is present. The lights, colors and dialogue are coherent and do not sound cheesy.Second act is predictable enough and you will know how it goes until the third act which is probably how you will guess.Overall the soundtrack doesn't stand out nor do the characters to be honest.

624,DJ_Reticuli,"Acting wasn't bad, suspenseful, horrifying, excellent effects, and faithful looking & sounding, but just a little too overt in the call-backs and mimicry.",7,"Romulus doesn't leave out the other movies, except for perhaps AVP, and has a good continuity with the rest of the franchise, including outings that I'm sure some people wanted to forget. It quite successfully takes a bit from prior alien movies and regurgitates it in a loving way, but at the same time, it's got its own voice and something special.To be honest, I had no idea this was a standalone film. I'd avoided following the development of Romulus because I, for one, didn't want anything about it ruined for me, and two, I thought it was some kind of highly commercial new TV series or miniseries, anyway. Finding out it was a movie was a pleasant surprise in the last few days.It is very good. Nice character development. Heartfelt in a way that successfully hooks you. My only complaint is that there are just sooo many obvious parts that are duplicating exact moments from the other films, and then all the call-backs and nods were excessive and took me out of it at times. I wish it'd just stood on its own feet and not done that quite so much. The duplicated lines of dialogue were especially not needed.People calling this a fan film are not wrong, but I think it's more than that even as-is, and could have been even more if they'd been restrained with the wink winks. If you're a fan of any of the other films, and personally my favorite is the theatrical cut of Aliens, I think you'll nonetheless be happy you saw this on the big screen.",2024-08-24
625,strike_trike,YES YES AND YES!,9,"Alien: Romulus explores the themes of not only sci-fi horror, but it pay homage to the Slasher with an incredible storyline that follows the some formula from Slasher in the 80s.Fede Alvarez deliberately sets his masterpiece into the combination of Slasher Sci-fi/horror with the small group of characters he created. It becomes clear that the characters seem like they're from slasher from the 80s. However, what makes this Alien stands out from other franchises is that it doesn't reveal important information when it's not the right time, which is extremely crucial to its genre.The film slowly takes you its extraordinary world with the character that doesn't know what lies ahead.The further twist is unpredictable, leading to a new method of sci-fi horror creation that it doesn't have to end this way.Just go see it blind.

Firstly it looks great, you get a real sense of scale when onboard the Space Station, it feels like a huge vessel with wide corridors and vast sprawling spaces. There is also strong use of elements including temperature, gravity and sound when flipping between the interior of the space station and space itself.The characters are interesting enough, each driven by their own goals and emotions based on their unique experiences with some characters explored much more than others. The film is well acted especially from the leads, Cailee Spaeny as Rain and David Jonsson who is fantastic as Andy, a difficult character to play. At times, Alien Romulus felt more into an action thriller than horror/suspense to me but I enjoyed the scenes of action, thrill, suspense and horror in the movie.What helped to take this movie up a level is not only did we get a fun Sci-Fi horror thriller set in space that manages to call back to the Alien franchise it also asked us deeper questions about the nature of technology, medicine, human nature and human survival.",2024-09-04
627,thesar-2,Alien's Greatest Hits,8,"If you wanted to love 1979's Alien, but it was too slow for you...here you go.While 1986's Aliens remains both my favorite film in this series and my all-time favorite action movie, this comes VERY close to matching the action in that first sequel. After the obligatory world-building and character development, this is all-but non-stop action.And I'm really digging this interquel (Prequel/Half-Sequels) trend. Starting with 2016's incredible Rogue One: A Star Wars Story and continuing with the great Saw X from 2023, 2024's Alien: Romulus is an absolute perfect match/follow-up to the original 45-years-ago.Rain, her brother and others are desperate to leave the mining planet they're contracted on and when an opportunity arises in the shape of an outer-space ship, they high tail it there. I can't lie to you about their chances, but... they have my sympathies.While 2018's Halloween wasn't an interquel, it must've been an inspiration to these creators. You should be able to find an entire series worth of Alien Eggs (formally known as Easter Eggs) in this movie. And even though it's been a long time since I've seen any of the Alien films, I recognized the multiple nods/nostalgia to the franchise. They were awesome.It wasn't perfect, nor groundbreaking, but if you are a fan, this IS the movie for you. It's a ton of fun, straight-forward and you feel every bit of the tension/stakes. Unfortunately, not anyone here could match Sigourney Weaver or Ripley and one familiar character was pretty badly CGI'd (and luckily, that's the ONLY bad effect in this entire movie.) Still, the characters, at least half of them, were good. It just isn't about the characters this time.This is a major love letter to the original, modernized with creative and fresh ideas to truly kickstart this beloved series again. I'm very much looking forward to more to come.***Final Thoughts: From memory, here's my Alien Franchise ranking:1. Aliens (1986)

I feel it lacks character development; it's so superficial that you don't connect with any of them.

630,MooWoolf1,Remember?,6,"The movie at first felt really good. It kept the good things at start (just as the rest of the movies) and also kept the original design of the first movie. I really like that.Then some originality came into the picture. We saw a working colony. That was all original and very good.Later on things somehow started to get out of hand.We literally saw exact part of previous movies, again and again and again.Yea we saw the aliens, there was a tiny bit of originality in that, but all the rest was just copied to try to ride the same train that Star Wars did under disney hands.What was original felt unrealistic in that given universe.Being scared of guns? Come on..What they could have explained ""how do they grow so fast without taking in actual material that would otherwise build the body""... They missed the chance. (At the end we literally had a creature growing very big in about 2 minutes..)The ending was straight up horrible. The design, the idea, the almost exact copy of that scene. Even the fate of the creature was 95% the same..BUT my 2 biggest problems were the followings:1. There was no gravity, It only worked for a few secs before they turned it back on. Now, there was a lab mugs, glasses, everything on table as the people left it. Chairs standing next to the table. The makers of the movie flipped a single chair and that's that.2. You see 10-15 aliens in 0 gravity. The girl kills them. They gotta go back. Blood everywhere. Where are the remains of the aliens? Nowhere. Totally gone. Forgot to add to the scene..This is at the bottom of the alien movies.Sadly people don't like to or just can't think. So Ridley making movie about something more is just a no go for the people. What disney did with Ridley was a disgrace..I'd pay thousands to see what Ridley would have done to finish his idea.",2024-08-18

Also have seen all the predator Vs alien movies.This is definitely my favourite after giving a few hours to digest. One issue I will say just to remove the negative is there's a bit too many down times, would prefer to keep the tension up however set piece before and after those downtimes are well worth the wait.Gruesome with a great atmosphere and neatly designed moments and environment; every shot from the trailer is in here and just as good. Some of the characters are good, others just alright and expected a bit more but the horror elements more than make up for it.I get the critique that it feels a little like an alien high budget fan film, I got those vibes near the beginning once they board a certain ship however that quickly dissipates and everything falls into place and makes sense soon after, so A plus on that.The third act is wild and experimental for sure but for one loved it, especially the designs and finale, a great end to the movie.Bas excellent cinematography and some of the best space vista shots I've ever seen, ever.Great acting and sound design as well to elevate you into the characters seats and reactions.",2024-08-17
632,martinboo-225-82255,Review of Alien: Romulus in 4DX,10,"Review of Alien: Romulus in 4DXAlien: Romulus brings a fresh perspective to the beloved Alien franchise, seamlessly blending the haunting, claustrophobic terror of the originals with modern filmmaking techniques. Watching it in 4DX only amplified the intensity, creating an immersive experience that makes you feel like you're living the nightmare alongside the characters.From the moment the film begins, the 4DX effects grab your attention. The chairs' movements mimic the shaky, unstable environment of the spacecraft, while atmospheric effects like wind and mist heighten the suspense. The jump scares become even more effective with the added sensory inputs, making the terror feel visceral and immediate.Visually, Romulus nails the iconic aesthetic of the Alien universe. The dark, industrial look of the ship contrasts with the menacing beauty of the Xenomorphs, whose appearances are always accompanied by perfectly timed 4DX elements that will have you gripping your seat. The sound design, enhanced by 4DX speakers, further drives home the relentless tension, immersing you fully in the horror.Overall, Alien: Romulus in 4DX offers a spectacular cinematic experience. The combination of the film's thrilling content and the 4DX effects makes it a must-watch for fans of the franchise and newcomers alike. It's a pulse-pounding, immersive ride that breathes new life into the Alien saga.",2024-08-30

I'm not usually shocked at a movie these days, especially one that I was so looking forward to seeing. The storyline was boring at best. Nothing, imo, innovative or interesting. I didn't care about any of the characters, they were not interesting, not up to the previous chracters in the franchise's movies. I could always find them interesting, at least. I sat there waiting for the movie to ""take off"", it took a while from the start of the movie to get anything going. And then it was pretty much really loud music and one traumatic scene after another. At the end, my brother said, ""Wow, they threw everything but the kitchen sink in that one."" He's a big Alien fan, too. I had to laugh at his comment because it was so true. All the action scenes, big music and scare tactics don't make up for a lack luster screenplay and uninteresting characters. I'll admit this, at every moment where they went for the shock/surprise factor, I did jump. I sat through the movie feeling embarrassed (can you imagine) for the franchise. I don't like great movie franchises going down in this way. I don't regret seeing it though. I can't imagine the franchise going on, but if it does, I'll probably continue to hope for another great Alien movie. Sorry I don't have much to say about the movie...there wasn't much there for me other than the loud music and action scenes, neither of which made it a good movie. If there was a ""Meh"" category, that's where I'd put it.",2024-08-17
634,watsonjmax,Felt like the originals... Classic Alien vibes,10,"Great survival horror with suspense that echos the original alien movies, finally a good alien movie since the abomination of The Covenant and Prometheus. Great characters, full of action and a couple good edge of your seat moments and it leaves you wanting more. There were a couple great throwbacks to the original movies, I loved that the tech and settings very much felt like the movie could follow the original Alien and Aliens. ""The best in the franchise since then"" and after Alien Romulus the consensus needs to be that we need more Alien movies with this vision. A familiar face from the 1979 movie too!",2024-08-16
635,jon_pratt12345,Enjoyable if Unoriginal Action Film,6,"Alien: Romulus leans in to the style and aesthetic of Alien and Aliens. Much of the film takes place onboard a grimy, dark spaceship so there are many similarities to be drawn straight away.The first quarter of the film does well to build on the world of the Weyland company and its workforce. Which is a part of the lore I had always found fascinating. It's a great reminder that at the core of the alien franchise lies a stornch anti-capitalist message.The rest of the film is an action-oriented thrill ride. Every scene, shot and piece of dialogue is efficiently used to drive forward the plot and lay the ground for something to come, everything the audience is shown is necessary and pays off. So in that regard it's a satisfying, expertly crafted, propulsive action film.What Alien: Romulus lacks however is a genuine sense of originality. Of course this may be a foolish expectation, given it is part of a franchise. But in it's devotion to craft and very obvious yet affectionate borrowing from the early films, Alien: Romulus didn't deliver a fresh perspective. Which for me is needed in order to justify the continuation of the franchise.",2024-08-24

640,cinemapersonified,Pretty Good Movie,7,"Rating: 7.3
Overall, a pretty good movie as this feels like the first Alien film that truly feels like a horror movie, but it relies so much on the original film that it does not feel like Alien: Romulus is adding too much to the story.Direction: Pretty Good
The direction on a macroscale is good, as the horror elements are well executed; the direction on a microscale is decent, but pretty standard; the storytelling is a horror rendition of the original Alien movie (following a similar template after the exposition); they build tension very well, as it makes this movie feel like a true horror movie as opposed to the previous moviesStory: Decent
The concept is a stand-alone sequel to the original Alien franchise that feels more like a traditional horror movie; the plot structure takes cues from both horror movies and the original Alien movie; character writing is pretty shallow and feels kinda similar to the original movie for the protagonist and antagonist (but not as good); the story relies a little too much on the original movieScreenplay: Decent
The dialogue is decent; the symbolism piggybacks on the original Alien movie because a lot of the themes and messages are the same; the foreshadowing is pretty goodActing: Decent to Pretty Good
Cailee Spaeny: Pretty Good (Pretty standard horror performance and does a pretty good job as the lead)
David Jonsson: Pretty Good
Archie Renaux: Decent
Isabela Merced: Decent
Spike Fearn: Pretty Bad (Very typical 'screws loose' British teen)
Rest of the cast: Decent (The entire cast captured youth well and played their roles during the horror sequences)Score: Pretty Good
Helps establish the tone and tension of the horror sequencesCinematography: Good
Helps capture the horror sequencesEditing: Good

Helps bring to life the horror sequences, but the deep-fake technology felt a little tackyProduction Design: Good
Pays homage to the original moviePacing
The pacing is pretty fast-paced and good for a horror movieClimax
Climax is executed well but is a little too similar to the original movie, feeling almost like a shot for shot remake at some pointsTone
Tone is a blend of horror with sci-fi (something the original movie tried to do)Final Notes
It does a pretty good job picking up right where Alien left off, but it kinda feels like it relies on it a bit too much.",2024-09-01
641,jeremiahcourter,The best since the 1979 original,10,"This movie far exceeded my expectations. I have always been a huge fan of the original 1979 alien. In fact, it is my absolute favorite movie of all time. I so love the original that I judge all the following movies based on how close or how far away it moves from the feel and tone of the original movie. Well, I absolutely loved the sequel, aliens, I never thought it was anywhere close to amazing as the first since the first is a true horror film and not an action movie. And despite the flaws of alien 3, I was one of the few who actually enjoyed it because I felt that it too was a bit closer to the feel of the first movie. Alien Romulus checked all the boxes of what I believe really made the first movie. Incredible. It was dark and creepy. You are horrified by the violence and the sexual violence and the creation abominations in the film and the music was gut-wrenchingly awesome and eerie..Really There's so much I could say that just simply cannot do this movie Justice. It absolutely had the nostalgia factor but was not nostalgic for its own sake. The creators of this movie intentionally kept the technology the same as the first movie with similar lighting and feel in such a way where you can immediately watch the 1979 movie and then step into this 2024 sequel and there would be so much cohesion between the two that it would be hard to recognize that there is a 40 plus year gap between them.This movie brought more nuance to why the Wayland company did what it's doing and why it was so obsessed with the xenomorph and what it hoped to do with it. As well as tying in plot lines to Prometheus and giving homage to the other movies in its own subtle ways, including the amazing video game alien isolation. I found almost nothing wrong with this movie outside of a couple of poor moments of CGI with a person's face.I give the original alien movie 10 stars and this one 9.5. As someone who is always loved the original as the best move of all time, I can happily say that this movie is a very close. Second. Well done and thank you to the creators and all those who made this amazing movie possible!",2024-08-17
642,danielgroza,Toasty!,7,"To say that ""Alien: Romulus"" is a cliché, is a cliché in itself. Director/writer Fede Alvarez (the guy who made the popular ""Don't Breathe"" back in 2016--I have nothing else on him) and his cast of relatively unknown actors are not threading any new grounds--literally, as the plot takes place on the same spaceship as the original 1979 movie and serves as a sequel to it. However, even if the movie has modest ambitions, it does its job well. This is a traditional Hollywood horror movie: it has its jump-scares, disturbing and stomach-churning moments, and the cast is methodically and creatively picked off one by one in gore-tastic fashion.With its trademark xenomorph-inspired creatures let loose to cause dreadful havoc across its two hours runtime, this movie is also just good enough to feel like it deserves the ""Alien"" badge in its title as fundamentally, the ""Alien"" movies are about creepy things jumping at you from the dark. The reason why the original ""Alien"" was such a referential horror movie is because of its Hithcock-ian principles of keeping the monster hidden as much as possible--I will never forget the dark, cold, endless mechanical crevasses in the ship's walls, all places where the xenomorph would constantly sweep in and out of view. ""Romulus"" has nowhere near as much patience. The aliens appear, destroy, make themselves unseen and repeat. Each iteration however is more and more interesting and horrifying, and there is a particular gravity-bending scene which I liked.But what is the point of ""Alien: Romulus"" anyway? First of all, the title refers to one half of the derelict spaceship's quarters, and of course it's also a reference to the legend of the Roman Empire's founders, Remus and Romulus, who were supposedly raised by a wolf. But the reference doesn't make much sense in the context of the movie. Artistically though, its purpose is an excuse for Alvarez to showcase his textbook horror skills which while executed perfectly, have a college boy feel to them. And business-wise, it's a way for the up-and-coming cast composed of Cailee Spaeny (who had a lead role in the critically acclaimed ""Civil War"") and David Jonsson (who gives a breakthrough performance as a conflicted android) in the lead roles among others to impress the Hollywood brass--and horror is a great genre for that. It requires constant muscle-twitching but controlled emotion, distress, shock, realization and madness. All of which these actors displayed enough to make the movie--and indeed themselves--work.",2024-08-26
643,natesignup-93741,I thoroughly Enjoyed the film,8,I've been watching all the Alien movies from start to finish and so far this one is the scariest one the final moments had me on the edge of my seat.There's definitely a formula to these films which makes them familiar and fun. I know what's going to happen without knowing what's going to happen.Overall the whole movie was a great time and I am happy to see the movie go back to some basics on the horror side. 100% watch it.The only thing I want from the Alien films is the timeliness to be more laid put for me.

Every scene felt immersive, with atmospheric locations that perfectly captured the eerie and tense mood of the film. The environments truly brought the world of *Alien* to life.The special effects were also top-notch. From the alien creatures to the futuristic technology, everything looked impressively realistic.

And thus i fell for all the 'return to the roots' marketing they put out before release.To start of with the only redeaming qualities of the movie: the visuals and the cast. It's absolutely gorgeous and the acting is more than decent.Other than that... bad with a capital B.The plot has more holes than a swiss cheese, and not only does it kill this movie but opens a lot of holes in the greater lore of the Alien franchise.It reuses a ton of lines from the original almost word for word, it's filled to the brim of memberberries and 'easter eggs' and all in all it lacks any originality. Feels more like a cashgrab trying to milk the same beats as Alien 1, but without the character and soul of it.Character motivations are all over the place. I mean they shift on a dime.It also does the Marvel thing of trying to one-up itself about a dozen times trying to raise the stakes again and again untill it becomes tedious to watch.In comparison, Resurrection feels like an excelent movie.

649,silasedwinjohnson,Plays It Safe.,6,"It's pretty good. This movie's existence bothers me on the level that I have always wanted to see David the Android's story continued because I think he is the best character in any of these movies and if Ridley and his team truly took their time they could make a movie to rival the original. I however, acknowledge that the movie we got is better than both ""Prometheus"" (2012) and ""Alien: Covenant"" (2017) as well as all the other alien films made after ""Aliens"" (1986). This movie is solid and it's hard for me to criticize it because of how safe everything is played.I do think that this movie is nowhere as interesting as Ridley Scott's prequels, nor the film Ridley was planning to make instead of this one, but due to Disney recognizing that Ridley's ambition leads to lower profits and a potential for lower critical response, I understand why we got this movie instead of another David film. It's hard to mess up a movie like this because it's just another horror film.Really quickly, I'm going to go through this movie and talk first about what doesn't work well, then what works decently well, and then what works really well.The only thing that is bizarre about this movie is that they felt the need to reference other alien films. I appreciate some of these references, but some go just a little bit too far. I don't need to see a weird CGI rendering of the late Ian Holm. It should be a rule from now on that movies are not allowed to creepily resurrect dead actors... it just goes too far. Don't get me wrong, Ash's character in this movie is essential, but we could have just gotten another man to play the android instead of a weird digital effect that appears unfinished. I also shouldn't have to mention the reference to Alien: Resurrection (1997) that we get in the final half-hour of the movie. I won't spoil what exactly it is, but it might have been a little too far.Now, this goes without saying but the visual effects and music are all really good. These are by far the best looking xenomorphs we've ever had and they truly do feel real. People also have been praising this already but the tone in this movie is also good. After watching this movie, it's hard to see any of the other sequels as real horror movies but this one definitely is. The suspense, buildup, gore, action set pieces and cinematography are all great for establishing this tone.The thing about the alien franchise that we all like to collectively ignore is that the human characters themselves are all kind of... the worst thing about these movies. I could count on one hand the amount of characters I actually like from the original quadrilogy. David was such a nice thing in the prequels because he was an actual complex and well done character, and while he's not as good as David, I am happy to say that we have a character in this movie who I can say was written well alongside David and Ripley who if we're being honest are the only other interesting characters in this franchise. I won't spoil his arc, but Andy the Android played by David Jonsson is a fantastic character. I was genuinely invested in his story... it's just really good.",2024-09-01
650,visitlv,A solid addition to the Alien family.,8,"I have to admit, I didn't know what to expect from this film. The trailers looked good, marketing was a little low key. Then there was Alvarez at the helm for director, which I was a little apprehensive for. I've seen some of his films and they are, meh-good but not earth shattering. I went to the local cinema last night with my wife (she rolled her eyes when I told her what we were going to see).During the film I had the odd glance at the wife and it was clear she was going through a bit of a rollercoaster in terms of body tight against the seat to balled fist Infront of her face and a pensive look of, well......terror. As for me there were some genuinely unformfortable moments, ive been a fan of these movies for years and I have to say there was plenty to get the tension up during the film.Overall, the film was good, I enjoyed the references to the greater Alien world, a few moments could have been done away with. The final act was....different, but overall well done and bonkers. It was good to see that Alvarez has range in terms of not just focusing on gore porn, but making the most of creating tension.I enjoyed it, hopefully, this leads on to more exciting additions.",2024-08-15
651,drummerlaci,2/3 greatness 1/3 disappointment,6,"Let's see the positives. The world building the atmosphere is genius. You can almost feel the environment on your skin. Prioritizing practical effects over CGI pays off for sure. All in all visuality is superb. Sound effects are on the same high level. The acting is okay too.Now take a look on the negatives. The story starts off great, the mining planet, the motivation to leave the planet, the arrival on Romolus, the exploration of the space station, the first encounter with the xenomorph are all okay. All is fine in the first 2/3. Unfortunately from the ""prometheus point"", the last 1/3 of the film is like an absolute mess. Illogical, far-fetched and dumb. The last 30 minutes is so embarrassing that it manages to ruin the whole movie. I just wish the theater had a power-outage around 1h30m so I wouldn't have to see the ending.In conclusion the movie starts promising but fails at the end.

653,Joystealer,Alien 9,6,"Alien Romulus. Another Alien movie. Alien 9.Yes, if you count every movie from every franchise where an Alien showed up on screen (Alien, AvP, Prometheus...), this is the ninth instalment.While watching this one, I imagined the main writers sitting together in a bright meeting room, with a huge white board and a thick black marker pencil.""C'mon guys let's brainstorm and write down everything that has happened in the previous 8 Alien movies, and we'll see if there is still anything that hasn't been done yet that we could shove into Alien 9.""Oh boy, this must have been an arduous task to say the least, but I must admit that they have mostly succeeded.There are a few genuine good ideas that make this movie worth watching. The first being that we are taking the point of view of the colonists. I thought right off the bat that this was pretty cool. It is of course a callback to the colonists in Aliens (Alien 2), but this time we follow the perspective of some actual teenager colonists so it's kinda refreshing. Of course, they do act as stupid teenagers and they are mostly annoying but hey, this is an Alien movie, so they all die. Can't complain.I'm not sure what to think about the new ""artificial person"". I liked the idea of him being dysfunctional and kind of a victim which was a new thing, but they depart from that later in the movie to turn him - again - into an uninspired evil robot which I think is a bit of a shame. We've seen the evil robot act countless times in Alien or Prometheus (Alien 7), and he's not even the only evil robot in this movie so, I believe that was unnecessary.Other than that, there are two or three scenes that really stand out, two of them including the face huggers. I always thought that the face hugger was actually more terrifying than the Alien itself. Needless to say, Fede Alvarez understood this and he uses the crawling creature to its maximum potential, with great effect. Well done there.Another scene that comes to mind for its originality is the no-gravity sequence where Jennifer Lawrence has to swim through thin air while avoiding the acidic blood of a bunch of Aliens she just blew-up Rambo style. I say Jennifer Lawrence because I don't know the name of this new, random Hollywood actress which looks exactly like most of the other Hollywood Actresses of the last two decades. Jennifer Lawrence is the first one that came to mind, so we'll call her that.Aside from these few moments that felt pretty fresh, almost everything else in the movie is either completely rehashed from previous Alien entries (to the point of copy-pasted lines of dialogue) or coated with a huge layer of Nostalgia sugar cream. Yes, this is definitly another ""hommage"" movie, Such as the JJ Abrahams Star Wars or Ghotbusters Afterlife; It's full of mindless fan-service. That said, I would call it fan service done right. It is definitly closer to Ghostbusters Afterlife than Star Wars 7, which is a good thing.If you're a fan of the franchise, you'll probably enjoy this one.",2024-08-27

The movie looks, sounds and overall feels real. On a budget of around 80 mil. This still might be the best looking movie i saw this year and that's saying a lot. What they were able to do with practical effects is jaw dropping and i really want everyone reading this to go check the behind the scenes.Acting in it is also great with the stand out performance being 100% David Jonsson.The score goes wild and sadly i had to go to the bathroom at a point in the movie and when i came back the track ""there's something in the water"" played and surprised me how well it fitted this new alien movie. The sets are also amazing and again everyone needs to check out the behind the scenes.The story is fine, but going in don't expect it given you anything. This is the kind of movie you go watch to have fun really.

My personal favourite being Aliens.But oh my Lordy, Romulus exceeded my expectations and they were already quite high.I absolutely love the Evil Dead remake (I think it's pound for pound one of the best horror movies out there) and so I was just super excited to see what Fede Alvarez was going to do with Romulus. He did not disappoint. He took everything I love about the Alien franchise and made an explosive awesome film that I already cannot wait to watch again (and again and again).Granted I didn't quite know how I felt about the ending when watching it in the cinema but after processing it and considering the rest of the franchise I realise now I freakin' love this film.It has everything, it's scary, it's nail biting, it's emotional, it's epic, it's just one brilliant Alien movie.One thing I would say is make sure you get to watch this in a cinema with the biggest screen possible.

For many years we have waited for someone to pickup the franchise and take us back to 1979 & 1986 by delivering a movie that is both cold and dark...... my goodness Fede Álvarez did just that.Cailee Spaeny was such a great choice as the lead role, she absolutely thrived as did David Jonsson as our Weyland synthetic. Special shoutout to Isabela Merced (as it's spoiler free, I won't say anything other than, boy oh boy she had a rough time).The scene setting in act 1 was everything it needed to be and a very back to basic approach. We all know how these movies play out and whilst we sit and wait for the inevitable, the tension leading up is fantastic with a whole new take on what I believe to the best chest bursted scene in the franchise, yes i said it!What follows in act 2 is the typical 'cat and mouse' between human survivor and xenomorph with a familiar feel to Alien & Alien Resurrection, highly enjoyable but this movie really ramps it up in the final act.Everything we loved from the first four movies were taken to make this an extremely tense ending.Unbelievable movie!",2024-08-17

However, these films may lose their replay value because their impact relies on those initial surprises. They're like a viral song with a big debut, but the artist fails to sustain their success, eventually fading into obscurity.A 4/10 doesn't always mean the film is mediocre; it can be an amazing film, but one that only works the first time you watch it. If that's the case, I'll make sure to note when a film is fantastic but lacks replayability. Some movies are perfect for a single viewing, and watching them again only diminishes their impact.On the other hand, some films may not be extraordinary, but they're rewatchable. They hold up better over time, even if they aren't as groundbreaking. I value replayability because I enjoy owning movies, and I wouldn't want to buy a ""10/10"" film if I never want to watch it again. So, why recommend a film as if it's the best when it lacks staying power?",2024-09-12
660,Squirrel_the_Grip_1,"In Space, You really can't hear people Scream!",9,"Alien:Romulus is a damn near sequel in the Alien Anthology series. With the added story to make it more interesting and terrifying, it had you gripping from start to finish with amazing cinematography and art direction that stayed true to the mythos that Ridley Scott started in 1979. The sound design also stayed true using the original sound to establish the universe. The music score was a nice blend of the original score from Jerry Goldsmith along with more variation of heightened and suspense. The young actors in the film also dialed it in and made it even more compelling. If you're a fan of Alien, I highly recommend Alien:Romulus!",2024-08-17
661,jamesholverstott-43730,"Nothing but the same, sadly.",6,"If you like horror franchises like Halloween or Friday the 13th or Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and you also like the idea of the Alien, then you'll enjoy this movie. It breaks zero new ground, recycles lots of old tropes, and throws in rotten eggs for the youth, who can't seem to watch or enjoy standalone movies but must have callbacks and obvious foreshadowing to be satisfied. The characters are just vapid, and who survives is stupid-obvious. The CGI of you-know-who is so sad. The monsters are awesome as always. But how an indestructible beast manages to get sidelined by rather lame humans is still, nine films later, idiotic. A not-awful watch but not in any way a rewatch. Dull and uninspired.",2024-11-24

Tho Fede Alvarez & Rodo Sayagues' writing has holes, it does homage the previous 'Alien' movies well, and Alvarez's direction is so stunning that it makes this 7th franchise entry (the 4th chronologically) a fine and fitting way to launch 'Aliens' at a new generation.",2024-10-16
663,MovieswDan,Great until the end,7,"The newest Alien movie, Alien: Romulus, is now in theaters. Directed by Fede Alvarez and starring Cailee Spaeny, Romulus takes place about 20 years after the events of Alien and 37 years before the events of Aliens. The film follows Rain (Spaeny) and her AI Andy as they join a group of young colonists who quickly find that they are not alone when they step aboard a derelict space station.The worst part about this movie is its ending. Up until the final act of the film, this is a great sci-fi horror that lives up to the past films in the franchise. Alvarez did a great job of honoring the prior films while also making this his own and Spaeny delivered yet another brilliant performance. David Jonsson stole the show, however, with his performance of Andy. He did such a great job that I would have believed it if someone told me that he is actually not a real person in real life and actually is an AI. The way the film was shot really added to the horror and suspense which made it so enjoyable, and this is a true testament to the talent of both Alvarez and director of photography Galo Olivares. I have to say that I hated the ending of the film and it came close to ruining the whole movie for me. Fortunately, the first 3 quarters of the film were so good that I overall still really like this film, but I thought that the twist at the end was just stupid.This movie is a ton of fun and despite the ending I thought it was overall very good. As expected, the film is extremely graphic and does have some frightening scenes. In my opinion, this only made the movie better. This is the type of movie that is way better in theaters and I hope you get to go out and see it before it leaves.",2024-08-23

I can't say enough, just go watch it yourself. I had complete trust in the movie and I'm thoroughly satisfied with it. I did at times get lost as to where the crew is headed but all that doesn't really spoil the fun or get in the way of enjoying this well made film. I would also have liked for the Alien to have a bit more provenance in the film as somewhere it's horror was overshadowed by other things.",2024-09-08
665,charles000,"I wanted to like this latest Aliens production, visually well done, but . . . . .",7,"I wanted to like this production, having been a fan of all the Aliens related films (Prometheus might be at the top of that list), but what I came away with was basically a remake of the original film. Not there's anything wrong with that, as it was still a well produced example of the concept, but not very original.Pehaps for younger audiences who have not seen the first of the Aliens series, this seemed like an excitingly original foray into this type of story, but unfortunately, the cliches that were woven into this just became too obvious as the film progressed.Of course, some of this was purposefully done, weaving in little bits of humorous references to the original production at various moments. If anything, it turned out to be a sort of character study on people making irrational, emotion driven decisions rather than more reasoned thought processes under duress. In several of the critical moments, when the next dire fate was about to be encountered, it stemmed from yet another one of these emotion driven choices, the flaws of which were made glaringly obvious to audience, but maybe that was part of the design strategy in this story.Visually, it was well done, the CGI expertly created, though there were some technical details in the story which suggested much more attention was paid to the ""look and feel"" ambiance, rather than the implied technical credibility (and related plot holes) in some parts of the story. Overall, it's still a fun watch, but just seemed at bit, well, shallow, precitable, almost like a retro recap rather than a more original take on the Aliens concept.The female lead was well played, not as a Sigouney Weaver replacement, she had her own identity and unique character. David Johnson as the ""Andy"" synthoid was perhaps the most uniqely original, interesting character in this production. In any case, I want to give this version of the Aliens story credit where it's due, but still, it just seemed more like a remake of the original story than forging its own unique path.Having said that, I'll still go with 7 stars, as it was well produced.",2024-09-12
666,mark-deckard-1967,Superb addition to the Alien saga,9,"The Alien universe has become a genre of art unto itself. The ability to suspend us in horror and mystery within an ever blossoming flower of H. R. Giger stylism must be reserved for only the most worthy offering. This film has not only met the standard but contributed to the evolution.The film stands out in that it is filled with insightful futurism, groundbreaking vision, as well as a innovative young cast who skillfully deliver a compelling performance that not only recaptures the original audiences but also invites the next generation of movie goers into this unfolding macabre of the Alien legacy.Unlike so many films we have endured in recent times, there is not a single eye-rolling moment. Likewise at no point was my mind able to get out ahead of the plot in a way that I felt that I knew what was coming next. Yet the subtle homage to the previous installments was subtly woven in in a way that rather that borrowing or ripping off, seemed to tell us that history would continue to repeat itself because of human hubris as well as human determination to survive as a species.Previous recent installments put many puzzle peices on the table. This particular chapter provided so much clarification as to what is happening with the Wayland agenda.There are subtle themes that give us new reasons to grapple with the intersection between intellegence and technology and the trust we place in the coming technrevolution.Alien Romulus is a strong and admirable acheivement that I look forward to watching again at home.",2024-08-22
667,hamzaarifshuja,Alien: Romulus,6,"I can't say it really added anything new but it brought back the tension and atmosphere of Alien and Aliens and made the Aliens actually terrifying again. I would say the weakest part of the movie is the characters, they're just not as interesting or memorable as they were in the first two alien movies. If this had come out relatively close after the first two aliens I would probably give it three Stars but since it did come out after a bunch of pretty bad Alien movies it gets an extra half star. I like the direction that's going in and if they can have better characters and add to the story the next one could be a truly legitimate four Star movie even compared to the originals. This is a very 'okay' film, it was obviously made by someone who's watched the original films because every few seconds there will be something that will make veterans of the franchise go ""oh yeah!! I 'member that scene from those older original movies!!!"". Unfortunately Romulus doesn't really tread any new ground in originality narrative wise, it tries to hit the same beats as the original Alien at times without really understanding why the original worked so well. To play the advocate I will say something good about this movie is the world/set design and practical effects are absolutely great and there's some really terrific shots throughout, its just a shame that for me this felt like a bit of a wasted opportunity that doesn't really bring anything new to the series table.",2024-10-27
668,mcoulter876,Just....... wow,10,"After the chaos that followed the release of *Aliens* and the varied sequels and spin-offs, it was refreshing to finally see a film that paid proper homage to the original masterpiece. The decision to cast relatively unknown actors and actresses was brilliant, as their performances were nothing short of mesmerizing. Each one brought depth and authenticity to their roles, making it a joy to watch. The special effects were extremely well done, and the cinematography captured the essence of the first film while adding a modern touch. What truly impressed me was how the plot exceeded all of my expectations. Not only was the story engaging, but it was also easy to follow, and every detail made sense in the context of the narrative. This isn't just a movie for casual sci-fi fans; it's a must-watch for anyone who appreciates the genre. For those old enough to remember the original, this film will be both a nostalgic treat and an exhilarating experience.

It feels like they put all the Alien films into a blender, added a dash of 'Prometheus,' and this is the result. It's entertaining, but I was hoping for something more innovative, built around the essence of the original Alien film.Andy stood out as a character, but overall, the acting was subpar. In the end: it could be much worse, but it could've been much better too.A solid effort, but ultimately forgettable for die-hard fans. But, wait the moment.

The cast was young unknowns, so not on them..There were many cut & paste sections of background visuals, sets and sound effects from previous instalments, so not on that..The script was so basic and lacked depth or substance ie. Describing taking a jacket off as it's hot in here, as if it was written by Ai, so not on that..So what DID they spend that mountain of money on...marketing hype?",2024-10-20
671,siderite,"Actually, really good!",8,"I dreaded watching this film. Not because of the terrifying xenos, but because it was an Alien movie featuring teens in a post AvP and Prometheus world. And it had that terrible name, too. Happy to report that it's actually a pretty good Alien entry!In a way, this is an alternate version of a third entry in the original Alien series. It ignores Alien 3 and it incorporates some ideas that were introduced in Alien: Resurrection.The teens are actual young adults, people who work towards a goal in a corporate lead environment like a Weyland-Yutani mining colony. You can imagine that in that place people grow up fast. There are still the usual Western emotional shenanigans, but they are few and far between. The main character is a strong young woman who has to juggle many things at once to survive, as is tradition, but the actress did a very good job with the role. I liked that they showed a bit more of the corporate world with more of the Blade Runner crossover idea underneath, but without committing to it.The story makes actual sense: simple survival run on a deadline with aliens with some idiots thrown in the mix to spice things up.An Ash model android makes an appearance as well as a mining model, with a design that is confusing to understand, but well played by the actor. The special effects are good, but not over the top. I loved the disintegration of the station and the way aliens and their hive looked. I liked the hybrid being - as usual, I rooted for the guy :-)All in all, there weren't many cringe moments in the movie. I enjoyed watching it from start to end. The various plot holes or random events that just had to happen to make something work were not big and happened rarely. It is not on par with Aliens, but makes a very decent entry in the franchise.",2024-10-18

If you stay awake, the reward is the original stunning camera work, special effects, and good enough stuff going on.There is a chance you could find some reuse of previous ideas so offensive and ""cheap-shot"" that you get up and leave.I have to score it high in spite of I don't want to, I didn't like how they reused too many ideas from previous movies.But I would see it again because... wow... this stupid thing looked great. Can a movie stand on ambiance alone ? ??? Somehow I kinda gotta sorta say maybe yes.

Reminded me of Ripley and Newt in Aliens at points.From the moment they get on the station the tension doesn't let up. The scares are well done. The characters and screenwriting is actually intelligent for once. The whole thing is dripping in the Alien low-fi sci-fi aesthetic unlike the last 4 films.

It's one of the rare movies where I actually rooted for them to die, and honestly, I didn't even care when they did. They made some of the most frustratingly dumb decisions I've ever seen in a sci-fi horror. That said, it wasn't one of the best Alien films, but it was still a solid addition to the series.

675,caitlinkimber,Loved it . Like alien and doom put together .,8,"This is so good . It's never wastes any time . It's BEAUTIFUL, set design is gritty but also polished . Everything looks so good . The interiors of the station and ships are immaculately constructed . They must have used a lot of budget on set design . The cgi has depth and weight and only fails a bit during the end for a few seconds when you can see the spacesuit in space and the person looks like a cartoon but other than that it's so cool . The characters are great they act very well , I believe all of them . They are all sweaty and dirty and you can feel the water and grit when you lol at them . I loved the space scenes with the beautiful galaxy images like a 3d phone wallpaper , they were mesmerizing . The shots of spaceships all looked legit . The action is very good too and had me sweating . There were unexpected moments all throughout , the person u thinks gonna get it doesn't then the one you think will live gets it etc and I've seen a lot of horror movies so that says a lot that I was surprised a bunch of times . Now to the issues . They are very minor cus this was a awesome movie . The characters that are attacked don't react with the same levels of pain . One person is shown with a chestburster and they did not seem to be acting in pain enough , it's supposed to be excruciating and yet it didn't come across like that . Another scene a person had a serious incident with a ahem ... special egg . And she's barely screaming . I don't know it just seemed like they weren't acting in pain enough . And the final alien . The you know what ( trying not to spoil anything here ) well it wasn't very scary . It could have been much more scary but that's just my opinion . The scenes where they are trying to sneak was hardcore and the chasing scenes had me on edge . All in all loved it.",2024-11-30

Nice to see that the great Ian Holm was given respect. Nicely done. So overall it was entertaining. Now get on with the story...

Whether you're a diehard alien fan, or this is your first taste of the Alien universe, there's plenty to enjoy for everyone.

It takes less than 50 minutes on romulus and thats if we ignore the face hugger scene.Compared to the last 35 years of disappointments, this is a very good movie. It gets the purpose of the series just right and re-introduces the tension of the earlier movies.However, that's all it is, a love letter to the earlier movies (and the alien isolation game) with nothing further to add. It's a shame as some simple modifications could have made this the film we all want.

The plot isn't that great. It felt like a complete remake of the original but with worse writings3. Plot points are terrible at times and predictable. If felt like the characters were constantly making bad decisions. I recently watched the new Furiousa movie and the decisions the characters made felt like something those characters would do in those situations. This one just seemed like it hit all the cliches and got lazy by having plot points that don't feel natural but rather forced.4.

681,thejamppa-94521,Flawed but entertaining,8,"I have been Alien fan over 25 years. I went completely blind for this film. I enjoyed it.First the negatives:
Lack of Originality. From very first scene you were able to guess the ending if you have watched alien films many times. Usually Alien films have been unique for better for worse and bear the signature of director. This acts as soft reboot and pretty much shares the paces with first two alien films and adds dash of Alien: Isolation in it.The positives:
So much practical effects. The practical goodness and the suits were back. Of course there was CGI and some de-aging. CGI is looked good to excellent 94% of the case and de-aging looked good 70% of the time. When they did not looked good, it didn't spoiled the immersion.Practical sets. Oh, my. Even some people have criticized the sets, to me they looked good. Grimy, worn, dirty when needed. I am personally happy how much practical sets were used. CGI were used more difficult shots and in backgrounds. Some of the wide shots were very gorgeous.Actors were unknown for me. Cailee Spaeny was solid choice and did good performance. David Jonsson was mvp for me. Him changing his voice and body language with way of speaking when needed made him steal almost every scene he was. I am definately going to put him on my list of actors to be watched.The General:
This seemed safe soft reboot of franchise. Looking back of the history of the films, it makes sense. It does create few problems, biggest one I have mentioned but this film generally surpasses majority of the soft reboots. Music was good, al though in few spots I might have used silence and not music but that's just me. Music constained familiar theme's of first two Alien films to set mood but also added something new.Plot even end was predictable for me, I enjoyed character introductions. Most of the character's were given enough flesh to be more than a side character just waiting to die. Although we could have spend few more minutes to build them.Actions of the main group were set, so their motivations were logical. Pacing in generally was good for this film, aside we could have spend few more minutes to build characters.All and all this is best Alien content what we have gotten since 80's. Its far from perfect, but its good enough. Its very good if you can look past lack of originality and predictibility. I hope this film does well enough, so we can get sequel. I would like to see Cailee Spaeny and David Jonsson reprise roles in sequel, that I hope would come and would create a brand new story, instead treading path of old ones.",2024-08-17

688,kimberlyely-27550,Best in years,7,"Alien: Romulus: best in yearsAfter six movies in the Alien franchise, (with the first one being the best). Fede Alvarez, who previously wrote Evil Dead. He now is directing Alien Romulus, which takes place between the first two Alien movies. Romulus stars: Cailee Spaeny, David Jonsson, Archie Renaux from Shadow and Bone, Isabela Merced from Instant Family.Rain and her brother Andy, team up with Tyler and kay, to travel to Yvaga, (a planet with sunlight.) However, to accomplish this, they need to steal cryo pods, to survive the nine-year journey.One of the reasons I found this movie just as good as the first, is due to the storyline, action, and suspense.Cailee Spaeny portrayed Rain, someone who wants to go live in Yvaga with her brother. She believes they can make a better life there. As a replacement for Sigourney Weaver's character, Rain was a good hero, who I feel had an interesting idea, to turn off the gravity to try and defeat all the Xenomorph. At first, I found Andy (a synthetic) played by David Jonsson, boring with bad jokes. However, on the ship, he becomes more interesting, due to him being on the wrong side for a while. Isabela Merced played Kay, a brave pregnant woman. My favorite part of this movie involves what she gives birth to. The seen was gross, but I enjoyed the action that followed. Tyler (Archie Renaux) did not have a ton to do, after producing the plan to steal the cryo pods. I do wish he had more screen time, only for the fact I liked his British accent.For the first part of Romulus, they do not encounter an alien, it is spent getting to know the characters. This made the movie more enjoyable since you care about the characters and want them to survive. In my opinion, it was a good choice to have Fede Alvarez write and direct this movie. I liked his 2013 remake of Evil Dead for the same type of storytelling. Alien Romulus has been the best movie in the Alien franchise, in years.",2024-08-24

First off I have to say, if you have never watched an Alien movie most of this movie will be great for a sci-fi horror movie. Now as a fan boy of the series since I watched my first Alien movie in 1987 and I have to say it was a joy to watch. Does it destroy or walk over the other movies in the series? No, but there was one line that wasn't needed in the movie. Visuals were like a flash from the past and done brilliantly. Story was a solid 8/10 with a few small gaps that I didn't like or could have been explained better but I assume that when and if they make a special edition like they have with almost every other Alien movie they will fill in those gaps.I truly think that this was a great movie in the series, it hit on almost every front. I wish that they had stolen or copied the video game Alien isolation's story vs this one but.... I enjoyed the movie, they only dropped the ball in the last 5min of the movie. The rest of it was worth the wait and look forward to the future of the series.",2024-08-16

Everything else in the movie is disconnected from the rest of the franchise when it comes to continuity. Nothing that happens in this movie will matter in the next one. Therefore I advise you to stop reading the reviews and go watch this as a standalone movie, without any expectations. If you do so I promise you'll have a much better time. The acting, practical effects, CGI, the horror aspect, it has it all. Just a 'classic' sci-fi space horror movie, and a good one.",2024-10-15

I regret listening to the good reviews because I could have saved a chunk of money and waited until it was available for streaming.First of all the actors were unknown, that's OK but since the last instalments featured well known actors I was kind of disappointed not knowing anyone.I was expecting a continuation of the last film Alien covenant but that wasn't the case. I liked both Prometheus and covenant a lot and have seen them multiple times.I found this film underwhelming in regards to no action until well into the movie, it plays entirely on a spaceship and the action was similar to the first original film.The actors delivered real terror no problem there but the running around on the spaceship kind of turned me off and kept me wishing for the movie to come to an end!I was a lot more terrified in the previous alien movies, this one I just calmly ate my popcorn without any jumpstarts.I would recommend to wait for streaming also because subtitles could be applied for better understanding the dialogues!

It had just enough fanfare. The pacing was slightly off, but the payoff more than made up for it.

There are a couple of things you need to kind of hand-wave or find your own justifications for with this being between ""Alien"" and ""Aliens"" in the timeline. The negatives for me was that there was a bit too much overt ""fan-service."" When you see it, you'll know what I mean. It's not as bad as Star Wars VI, but it was a bit over-done and unnecessary in my own opinion. If you liked ""Alien"" and ""Aliens,"" you'll most likely also enjoy this film.

The story heavily relies on themes and concepts already explored in ""Prometheus,"" which makes much of the film feel like a rehash rather than a fresh take. While it has a few atmospheric and visually impressive scenes, it lacks the deeper intrigue and philosophical undertones that made ""Prometheus"" stand out. Overall, ""Alien: Romulus"" doesn't offer much that feels new or exciting, and for fans of the series, it may come across as underwhelming.

Expertly paced, with a tight script and excellent cast; Romulus is full of surprises and eggs (pun intended).

Blah blah blah blah blah, zero attachment to any character. The lead girl and Andy's relationship is forced upon you and trust me it won't pull your strings. The movie starts off with surprising potential but then quickly cuts to mega loads of action and horror elements and any story you wanted to put your finger on goes out the window. CGI spot on, some stop motion and animatronic sprinkled in nicely. Definitely a scary movie at times. Entertaining with not much else to add.",2024-08-23
701,Maaarxie,A homage to the original,8,"We are taking it back to the original trilogy with this one. Well the first and second movies at least, we don't talk about 3rd here.You can tell that Fede Alvarez was either a huge fan of the original movies or just really did his homework because of the amount of homage and references this movie has from the original films. Also I don't know but it felt like the film is heavily inspired by the Alien: Isolation game or Dead Space because the vibes as well as the hybrid alien at the end is very similar to the Necromorphs from Dead Space, at least in terms of design.It's also nice to see Rook back even if he's still a little messy, they did good with the CGI maintaining how he looked during the first Alien movie. Also with wayward teens/young adults as the main cast I found it more believable that they would make constant human errors and mistakes, unlike the previous movies who are adult professionals and still make the most not so smart decisions.Like the first films the gore in the movie is also very minimal, there isn't really that much body horror aside from the more modern chest explosion scene.With all that said it's not a perfect film, there are still questionable parts and even lore plot holes but it's not really a major problem for the movie overall.I wonder if they make the next Aliens movie if they plan on offing the survivor here again which they seem to do. I know Ripley can never be replaced as the ultimate final girl in the Alien franchise but it's just bothersome how we go through this journey with a main lead, survive the everything, only for that survivor to just be unalived in the next movie.",2024-11-07

After Alien 2 they've been progressively less tense but more perplexing.Fede Alvarez's Don't Breathe was a nail-biting shocker so I gave this one a chance. Hesitant due to word of mouth that this was a ""best of"" collage from the franchise, I can confirm that I wasn't surprised then by what I saw. There is some of that trademark tension that Alvarez can build but I don't think big budget sci-fi is his cup of tea. He's a minimalist, just as Ridley Scott was when he made the OG mind you, but I swear that all the tropes of ""world-building"" (yawn) were shoved down our eyeballs at every opportunity.I had hopes when the opening shot of the vessel in space was silent - as it should be. But they just couldn't maintain the discipline and not a minute later I could hear the ship's internal beeps through the vacuum of space. My heart sank.The kids were too young! Surely the OG crew were significantly older. Alien should be adult horror sci-fi, not hardcore Harry Potter!Props to the creature effects, CGI, & lighting crews. The cast are not short of talent but our familiar antagonists give the characters little occasion to rise to.",2024-10-09
703,tommy-97761,"Poor, poor Kay",7,"Alien: Romulus pays homage to the Alien and Aliens, but sadly isn't anywhere near as good as either.Credit, where credit's due. The production design and cinematography are excellent. This really feels as if set between the two movies. A point worth making is that there's even smoking featured in the movie, which back in the 70s-80s was normal and made it's way into the movie, then it became absent in the more recent prequels. Since I mention the prequels, their principal flaw was the irrational behavior of it's characters. Gratefully, that is not an issue in this case. I only really take issue with one action, to which I'll get later. The rest of the plot development, while they could seem irrational to the audience at times are IMO justified when viewed from the POV of the given character. All in all they managed to come up with a pretty solid plot IMO, which ties the movies and the prequels nicely together. You'll get your fair share of world building, tense moments and action.I rate the movie lower than either of the Alien(s) movies, because for multiple reasons I just couldn't get into it. The movie kept reminding me, that indeed I was watching a movie.For one part it is the overabundance of references to the previous movies. Be it, quotes, props or even moments that mimic iconic parts of the previous movies. I guess to a new viewer this wouldn't be a big deal, but I kind of rolled my eyes as Rain was getting into the space suit towards the end of the movie. The choice for casting Rook was IMO also a bad call. Fans find it in bad taste and to new viewers it's just bad CGI. I really don't see the added value here.An another thing is the amount of plot holes and inconsistencies. Fede Alvares did a pretty good job of portraying the layout of the space station, with the unfortunate drawback that covering distance takes time. Time we are constantly reminded of. 20 minutes to impact event, 10 minutes to impact event, OK fine. While I can suspend my disbelief as to space travel, aliens and all that fantastical stuff, it needs to be grounded in some understandable rules. Covering a mile of ladder steps in 10 minutes just seems over the line and there are multiple such inconsistencies, but I want to keep my review spoiler free.Alien: Romulus is a very well made entertaining sci-fi Horror, but unfortunately I compare it against the high standard of its predecessors which are iconic and to this day excellent. This is just kind of a fun filler for the fans, but I doubt it'll be remembered in any way near as much as the originals. Attempting to add to this franchise and be remembered at this point is an uphill battle and Fede Alvares did as good a job as anyone could have hoped. Maybe if I weren't challenged to suspend my disbelief quite as much and with a bit less references it would have been a better movie, but then some other reviewer would shout demanding exactly those things, so it is what it is.As a last thing. When you watch the movie next time, try to put yourself into the shoes of Kay, the character portrayed by Isabela Merced. She had just the worst time of them all and she did nothing to deserve it.",2024-10-16
704,alexanderdrysdale,The Franchise Is Saved!,10,"After some pitiful attempts & crossover movies, this finally gives the fans something that truly belongs & worthy to stand-up against the original classics. Big fan of the Sigourney Weaver entries, but beyond that, no-one has done an Alien film justice, until Romulus. Prometheus & Covenant were a bit laboured & trying to be too philosophical whilst also focussing too heavily on a Robot antagonist in-lieu of the alien(s). No words are necessary to acknowledge the poor & disappointing 'Alien Vs Predator' movies. Hence, it was amazing to see the Director bring some good pacing / build-up in suspense, amazing sets / special effects with so many nods to the originals, as well as another strong female lead. Even spotted the inclusion of elements from the truly awesome PC & Video Game, 'Alien Isolation', which was such a fantastic gaming experience and would recommend to anyone who hasn't played it yet and a fan of the franchise. Romulus draws upon so many elements from the previous films, yet still has enough surprises to keep you immersed and entertained till the end (and wanting 'more'!). :)",2024-09-22

I've seen Alien, but I did so when I had been pretty little, so I don't really remember much of it. I also watched Prometheus the day it came out in theaters and despite the fact I had been fourteen back then, I could recognize it as pretty awful. My experiences, along with the mire that the Alien franchise has gone through since the second film, with garbage like the Alien vs Predator serie , really dampened my expectations coming in to the theater for this one. It seemed like to me the series has been riding off the coattails of two juggernauts that came out forty years ago and perfectly encapsulates the issue Hollywood has with milking everything they can out of a decent product (ie, Harry Potter and The Matrix). And yet, Alien: Romulus really impressed me. This movie felt exciting, terrifying, and most importantly, entertaining. While the picture did go on for far too long, with three to four moments close to the end where it felt like the film could have already ended, and scenes in the latter third of the film being almost campy and laughable considering the world the film had built, I still enjoyed the movie. The first third had been absolutely stellar, with suspense that I hadn't felt since watching Gravity (2014). It simply remains unfortunate that the film does not end strong, but I won't fret, because I am excited to see where this franchise go from here.",2024-10-03

Another thing that comes to my mind, is that at this moment it has a solid 7.5 rating, which makes me think that somehow a group inflated the ratings using social media or something, a 7.5 it just does not fit what I am seeing.

The film skillfully blends quality CGI (except for ""dead people""), practical effects, set design, and makeup, resulting in a visually cohesive and immersive experience. The casting is good, featuring talented but less widely known actors (which I prefer). And David Jonsson shines with a standout role that deserves some award recognition for his robotic personality. However, the unnecessary and MANY references to older films (that are still better than this) and a cameo left a bit of a sour note for me, along with a misplaced one-liner referencing a previous movie. Still, points for a creepy last threat.While the film is quite iterative, it still manages to deliver some fresh scenes and doesn't feel as repetitive due to its unique structure, some developments, and combination of different elements.

It's mainly a horror, but there is a nice mix of action. The actor that plays Andy, David Jonsson, is an incredible actor. You'll see just why when you watch the film. Cailee Spaeny, who also plays in Civil War, is very good. It's hard to match up to Ripley, and by no means am I saying that she does, but she deserves a lot of praise.

709,moatandbailey,"Visually arresting film that doubles down on horror aspects of ""Alien""",7,"Body horror, jump scare horror, psychological terror, monster horror, stupidity-being-your-worst-enemy horror, atmospheric claustrophobic dark places horror: it's all in there, man, in this well crafted film from Fede Alvarez. To be honest, horror doesn't really appeal to me, not that anyone cares to know but hah IMDB has this required characters thing so blah blah blah. No, but in all seriousness, I think being exposed at too young of an age, between the age of 7 and 10 in my case, to deeply disturbing horror movie themes and scenes probably scarred me subliminally- which, ironically, is precisely the motivation for horror- to disrupt you emotionally and evoke a response which can either be a roller-coaster like thrill or an actually profound intimation and commentary on disturbing truths. I feel ""Romulus"" accomplishes a little of both, leaning in on sound character development and capable, impassioned acting to sell the scares and drive home any poignant points about human existence, particularly, in this case, in the callous indifferent vacuum of space and in the callous indifferent vacuum of a dystopian corporation-controlled future. Our generally hapless characters run about whilly-nilly in this doubly hostile setting, and I, as an evidently non-fan of horror, am supposed to just sit by helplessly and watch them die, while munching away at popcorn and slurping Cola? Yes. So, as an unenthusiastic horror-movie watcher reviewing a decidedly horror take on ""Alien,"" it was a decent, but not great, horror movie. As a movie unto itself, it's not something we haven't seen before, particularly from an ""Alien"" themed movie, and I feel that detracts from the movie experience as a whole. I feel the film needed a little more time or allocation of time to breathe, to evolve, into those dreary, ominous, forbidding, and potentially horrifically lethal recesses of our minds and distant unknown far-flung places. Nonetheless, ""Romulus"" is a well-crafted film with excellent visuals, sound, and acting, which, by neither sinking nor elevating the ""Alien"" franchise, actually sets up a very do-able resurrection, especially after the headache that was, ironically enough, the dubiously named ""Alien: Resurrection.

And it's a very good intense horror/thriller. But it kind of fall short with the story and the characters.Overall, in terms of production value, this was an alien fans dream. We had practical aliens. There is obviously some CGI in there because making it completely practical would be virtually impossible at this point. But the score and the lighting along with the way it was edited made you really wonder what was gonna happen next. The grossness and ferocity of some of the gory scenes was very well done and unsettling (in a good way).Where it fell short was the story and the characters. The story was very mundane. In terms of pacing like most alien movies it's very boring for the first 45 minutes or so. They're introducing the characters setting the scene, but there's not much in terms of action or even in terms of moving the dialogue along it felt kind of slow. It goes from 0-100 real quick though after those first 45-60 minutes.In terms of characters, they were bad, but I didn't really feel connected to them. Yes they were desperate people were doing something desperate to get out of their sad life, but I didn't feel much emotion for them as The movie went on. But the Alien franchise usually doesn't have great character. It's about survival of the fittest.Overall, if you enjoyed alien, I would see this.

If you've never seen an alien film then you'll probably enjoy it and if you are a franchise fan that just wants to see a back to basics space horror away from all the convoluted lore of Prometheus and covenant, then this is probably the movie for you.That last one is me. This is the alien film I've waited almost 30 years for and Fede Alvarez delivers.I'm a huge fan of this franchise and I have been bitterly disappointed with some of the recent instalments even if there's parts of them I liked.This one keeps its promises. The xenos look brilliant and the practical effects are great, the tension is good and there's a couple of scenes that made me hold my breath, including some fun anti-gravity action. There's some great gore and one scene that had a couple of people in the cinema wincing.I really felt that the director understood the brief. The look and feel of the spacecraft captures the look and feel of the original being set 20 years after alien, and there's a bunch of great callbacks and Easter eggs. In fact there really is a tonne of fan service. One line in particular even nods to the comic books and video games.Overall though, it is a back to basics space horror with some good tension, great set pieces and that's what I've been waiting for.What I would say on the flip side is that I think we lose something with such a young, attractive cast and It feels a bit kind of millenialy. The rough and ready, mature crews of the nostromo and the sulaco just bring a bit more for me. Also I'm not that sure about the climax.

Cailee Spaeny plays Rain and she is the main character of the film and I thought she was great here. I know very little of her work but she definitely gives a strong performance here and is a great lead character that we are meant to care about and I think that I did for sure.Supporting Characters
My favourite character in the film is Andy played by David Jonsson. Early on we find out that he is a synthetic and I think the film is really clever in the way that it handles his character and his role amongst the group of young people. He deserves a lot of credit for playing this pretty emotionless character and manage to make him one of the most interesting parts of the film.Unfortunately, the rest of the group fair a bit worse and I really didn't care about any of them. The young cast come across as annoying especially the one played by Spike Fearn who feels like he should be in a completely different film.There is an appearance that is a big spoiler but made the film much more interesting and I thought it added a lot to the film but yeah I can't really talk about it so you will have to see the film to find out what I am talking about.Story
The story is interesting, the reason for these kids being on the station isn't that deep but when they get there, these characters encounter interesting things and there are valid and logical reasons as to why these Aliens are on the station. However, this film has a twist towards the end of the film and it just felt really weird and out of place for this film and that took me out of this pretty enjoyable experience.Script
The script is okay, there are some good dramatic dialogue and moments that made at least some of the characters interesting and made me care about them. However, there was a lot of weak dialogue, the build-up of the side characters and the introduction of our gang isn't handled particularly well.Style
The film takes stylistic choices of a mixture of Alien, Aliens & even a bit of Prometheus and I thought it really worked. The action is fast paced, but there are those slower more horror based elements and the fact that the film has both makes it more interesting. But the film does have a bit of a pacing issue and that is mainly from the first and last act that don't quite work and I wish they could have been handled differently.Overall
Overall, Alien: Romulus is an above average film that when it is at its best it is really good. However, there was enough that I didn't like to hold the film back from hitting the heights that I think it was capable of. I do hope that this franchise can continue but improvements will be needed for sure.Rating - 6/10.",2024-08-22

719,krv1985,A Thrilling Ride with Usual Story,7,"Alien: Romulus, directed by Fede Álvarez, is an engaging, edge-of-the-seat thriller, though it follows a rather routine plotline. The film struggles with originality, and the world-building, along with its timeline, feels confusing and unclear. The characters come across as shallow and fail to leave a lasting impression.That said, the visuals, CGI, and sound design are top-notch, effectively amplifying the tension in the thrilling sequences. The film evokes nostalgia with its lighting and camera work, reminiscent of the original Alien. The final 45 minutes are packed with action and thrills, with the Facehuggers and Xenomorphs delivering enough chills to keep the audience hooked.However, the movie could have been scarier and more impactful with stronger storytelling and a more coherent world-building approach. Despite its shortcomings, it's a decent one-time watch for sci-fi horror enthusiasts.",2024-11-25
720,sylysya,Couldn't have been better,10,"First of all, I am an avid Aliens/Predator fan. I've watched all movies associated with both countless times (for the good ones, once for the insufferable ones like AvP Requiem and Prometheus) so I was eagerly awaiting this movie and it did not disappoint! I loved the storyline, the execution, special effects, script.. the entire movie was fantastic from beginning to end.. I loved the way Romulus incorporated elements from each alien movie and tied things together.. I truly enjoyed this movie and will go see it a second time next week to catch everything that I missed the first time around . 10 out of 10 for me!!",2024-08-16
721,easter-21511,Star Wars clone,6,"For me, after the disaster that was Alien Prometheus and Alien Covenant, this film puts the final nail in the Alien franchise. With its teen caste its clearly not intended for long standing and long-suffering Alien fans but for a new younger audience. That's why, in my opinion, the characters were shallow and frankly boring. This could have been a film made for pre-teens, if not for the gore.Instead of taking this opportunity to reset the Alien franchise on an authentic new basis the producers decided they would make a Star Wars clone but pay repeated 'homage' to the original Alien film and its sequels, not least of which being the 'Super woman' character, created by a much more believable Ripley, but which in this film is taken to such new heights of absurdity as to be truly unbelievable.So many scenes are plucked from previous films that it exposes its lack of originality and fear of trying something new. Exemplified by the new alien at the end simply repeating the terrible ending of Alien 4.The 1979 film was so successful at scaring its audience because it had mature characters who we could identify with, set against an Alien that was as much felt and heard as seen. This film takes the opposite track and once we see one alien, we very soon see dozens, producing such overkill that by the end it's no longer scary but mundane.",2024-10-17
722,dfle3,Alien: Romulus. An expected return. 70%,7,"This is the kind of sequel that one might have expected to the original, classic, first outing of what has (xeno)morphed into a franchise/IP, namely, ""Alien"". By that I mean we have a return to 'the scene of the crime', that is, the spaceship Nostromo etc.I liked how the new soon-to-be-victims get a good background story for this kind of belated sequel. That is to say that there is some good worldbuilding accomplished, as far as where these new victims come from and their circumstances. One might describe that world as ""Dickensian"" (though I haven't read anything by Charles Dickens). Another point of comparison would be the world of ""Blade runner"". There are quite a few English accents in this film, which did make following the dialogue difficult at times, though that might have just been how that was recorded.A bigger picture is painted of the Weyland-Yutani corporation and their mining operations on a planet the new victims work at. Whereas I've found the character actions in the recent Ridley Scott outings of this IP to be really stupid, in this film, at least, the character stupidity does have motivations that are all too human.Overall, the film does have the requisite strong female characters we've come to expect from this franchise and there is the usual gore that audiences expect. Some scenes were quite tense. I won't give any more plot details. What has become clear to me now is that this IP is like one of those xenomorph eggs...they're just waiting in stasis to be rediscovered by film studios in the future, so there will be no story arc or resolution to all this. There will always be another sequel or prequel which may get made. That might be why I'm not loving these new films. The original Alien film was self-contained, with its own resolution. While there is still money to be made from this IP, the crime scene will always be revisited. The motion is perpetually sideways. Your grandchildren might not see how the story ends, if there are more of these films to come.Random notes:* In one of the recent Ridley Scott outings of this IP, I did comment on how the growth of the xenomorph seemed incredibly fast. This is brought up in this film. If you are asked why the xenomorphs grow so fast, well, now the answer is, I suppose, ""because they do"".* On the topic of Scott, some lore from his recent films is included here.* The xenomorph biology is already too complex for me...it seems to require a minor in xenobiology to grasp. My memory of the first Alien film is that the 'facehuggers' emerged from eggs, after a period of stasis, due to outside movement. In this new film, they seem to be running around for some reason, with no need for 'hibernating' in egg-form. This and my previous random note makes me wonder if we are getting new lore for the xenomorphs or whether the lore is now contradictory.* On the same topic, does this new film explain or contradict previous films as to why the Weyland-Yutani corporation wants these dangerous creatures? As a casual viewer of this franchise and one who doesn't immerse myself in the lore, I can't say.* The end credits list Ian Holm in a way which seems novel to me. I've noted this direction in films in my review of the most recent Indiana Jones film.* I did find amusing the scene where the spaceship engaged...windscreen wipers!* Didn't see any mention of where the film was shot but I may have missed it. Perhaps it was all in a studio in England or something. The end credits did mention contributions from Australia, New Zealand and Canada to the film's production. Maybe all Five Eyes countries took part.* Although this film is not for the squeamish, there was no scene as confronting as the 'birth' scene from the sci-fi film ""Xtro"". One scene in this film did make me wonder though...the scene where the abomination meets its host. That is, could there have been different outcomes for the host, depending on how they reacted? Perhaps one could make a parallel here with Frankenstein's monster. In any case, that abomination in this Alien film did bring to mind a monster in the XCOM 2 video game...and I suppose the monster related to it also has a counterpart in the Alien franchise.* Apart from the early worldbuilding which I enjoyed, there was also a terrific scene in zero gravity near the end of the film, involving acid. That struck me as something that would have looked great in 3D but I'm not sure if that is an option or not.",2024-09-03

The acting was superb and photography was sublime
An excellent movie all round.I hadn't heard much about it before seeing it, you don't need to be overtly critical or anything like that
The actor portraying the science officer was brilliant The fact that they used recorded images of Sir Ian Holm, who originally played Science Officer Rook was incredibly eerie

724,kennnnnn,6.3/10.0,6,"Positives: There were several moments where I was genuinely startled by the attacking aliens, which kept the tension high and made for an exciting watch. The story itself was very simple, making it accessible for younger audiences as well.Negatives: There were many puzzling decisions and actions by the characters, which undermined my curiosity and engagement. Repeated mistakes and mishaps felt frustrating, and I found myself becoming exasperated as the plot progressed. Additionally, the inconsistent speed of the aliens and their unrealistic, rapid growth felt jarring, especially if you prefer movies grounded in logic or realism. These elements detracted from my overall interest.Overall: While this movie had too many unrealistic elements for my taste, it did have several moments of suspense and jump scares.

725,nERDbOX_Dave,A Terrifying Return to Form,9,"""Alien: Romulus"" is more than just another installment in a beloved franchise; it's a triumphant return to form that honors the series' legacy and horror roots while boldly charting new territory. Director Fede Álvarez has crafted a cinematic experience that is both a chilling homage and a thrilling expansion of the Alien universe.The film's greatest strength lies in its relentless atmosphere of dread. The derelict space station setting is a character in itself, a decaying behemoth teeming with shadows and lurking horrors. The sound design is impeccable, with every creak and groan amplifying the tension.The film is both deeply respectful of the series' legacy and boldly innovative. The creature design is absolutely mind-blowing, bringing a fresh level of terror to the classic xenomorph, and Álvarez brings a far more terrifying version of the Face Huggers, something that was lacking in the previous films.At the heart of Romulus are two standout performances. Cailee Spaeny delivers a tour-de-force as the hardened Rain, a character who embodies the classic Alien heroine. Her resilience and determination are inspiring, yet she's also vulnerable, making her a truly relatable character.However, it's David Jonsson's portrayal of the android, Andy, that steals the show. His performance is a chilling blend of innocence and menace. Jonsson masterfully navigates the complex character, creating a truly unforgettable villain.While some may argue that the plot follows familiar territory, ""Alien: Romulus"" is less about reinventing the wheel and more about perfecting the formula. It's a film that understands what made the original so terrifying and delivers on that promise. This is a must-see for any horror fan and a triumphant return to form for the Alien franchise.",2024-08-16

Set between Alien (1979) and Aliens (1986), the story follows a group of space workers attempting to escape corporate control, only to encounter the terror of Xenomorphs on a derelict spacecraft.The film has been praised for its atmospheric horror, intense action, and strong performances by a cast including Cailee Spaeny and David Jonsson. Álvarez's direction maintains the franchise's legacy while injecting new energy, with striking visuals and a suspenseful score adding to the experience. While some feel the narrative is overstuffed, Alien: Romulus successfully bridges the classic and modern elements of the series, offering a thrilling cinematic ride.",2024-12-03
727,happyspaceinvader,"For fans of Alien, Aliens and Alien Isolation",8,"I really enjoyed this; the visuals are nearly all absolutely exceptional, with strong references to Alien, Aliens and Alien Isolation throughout, that latter one being my favourite video game of all time (I still play it).Yes, there's a lot of fan service and Easter eggs, and I thoroughly enjoyed nearly all of that.The only part of the movie that made me cringe was a reference to Prometheus which, along with Covenant, represent the lowest point in the franchise in my opinion. And then it goes a bit Alien Resurrection... but fortunately nowhere near as goofy... more like the video game Dead Space, so I was able to forgive it.Otherwise, I think the story is quite original, and takes a few unexpected turns. I found it tense, with some great action set pieces. The acting was solid, and particularly outstanding were the characters of Rain (who reminded me of Amanda Ripley in Alien Isolation) and Andy.There's also a surprise cameo, which... well, I don't know what to make of. You could criticise the visuals or you could believe they were deliberately a bit uncanny. I found it off-putting, but not to the extent it spoiled the movie.As a fan of the first two movies and the aforementioned video game, this gave me more of what I wanted, and very little of what I didn't.So, not perfect, but miles better than other recent entries in the franchise. I hope this represents a continuing upward trend, given the recent announcement of a sequel to Alien Isolation.",2024-10-18
728,vgtbphr,You Get Exactly What You Go In For,7,"I'm late to taste this movie, but, as of now, I believe IMDB user reviews have nailed this rating! As other reviewers have pointed out, this movie plays it safe and sticks to the tried-and-true, but it does it justice. The action is tense and varied, with moments of relief to let you catch your breath; the characters are likeable, albeit underdeveloped; the story is engaging; and the visuals are off the hook (there has been better, but if feeling awed by the vastness of space is your thing, there's some good content for you here, my friend)!

None of her choices were wise. Usually there is at least one likeable character but here, there is none and he so called climax was so poorly shot and lit that it completely non climatic.

It has what lacks in any of these shameless sequels that are pumped out by corporations.I would like to spend my last section praising the beginning of this movie.

732,Sam56800,Captivating but nothing timeless,7,"It's a good movie in the sense that it captivates you and keeps you on the edge of your seat once the aliens start appearing. And the way it was filmed (i.e. The evil dead style) was pretty fitting for the movie. The slimy, gross, disturbing spawning scenes and the overall grossness of the aliens was very well-done. Same with how the adult xenomorphs were depicted, it was quite terrifying. One downside to the film was the way it was edited. It was hard to follow the sequence of events at times (who was doing what, where each person was and what they were doing, etc). Another was the sheer stupidity of the characters. The only logical explanation for their poor decision-making was the fact that they were teenagers. But it was still satisfying to see them getting picked off because of their bad choices and lack of common sense. Overall, the on-screen alien stuff was great and suspenseful, and the rest of it was just alright.",2024-09-16
733,mesaxi,"Pretty good, a few flaws",7,"On the whole I was pretty impressed with Fede Alvarez's work here. The overall look of the movie, and most of the pacing was great. There were some creative scenes, some interesting new ideas, and a scene that borrowed from Tremors 2 (I'll call it a tribute). Unfortunately there was an ending that was so poorly executed that the movie lost a star.The main problem I see with this movie is DISNEY. This was Disney's first attempt at using their newly acquired Alien franchise, and while it was pretty good some of their nonsense is showing. For starters, the cast were a bunch of kids. Granted they behaved like a bunch of kids so it didn't feel too out of place, but that's not what I was expecting. The whole beginning on the planet where Cailee Spaeny is being mistreated by the corporation felt a lot like Disney Star Wars, it didn't start to feel right until they got into space. Perhaps the most Disney thing was the horrible CGI Ian Holm, because they've never found a grave they weren't willing to dig up for profits. The problematic ending was likely forced onto Fede by studio notes so they could make vague connections to the Prometheus storyline. And finally, there were several lines rehashed directly from the original movies in a terribly ham-fisted way that made me roll my eyes.But don't let my Disney rant turn you off, this is still a good movie worth watching for any Alien fan. I almost gave it an 8 until that ending, which brought it down to a 7.",2024-10-15

Every frame looked so gorgeous, it was eye candy. The characters made some questionable choices at some points. They really know how to play with your expectations. There are so many cool easter eggs and nods to the other movies. I can say this is my favorite movie this year so far. HANDS DOWN. WATCH IT ON IMAX.",2024-08-16
735,Junreviews,Decent Alien Movie with Room for Improvement,7,"As a huge fan of both sci-fi and Alien movies, my expectation was really high and wanted the movie ""Alien: Romulus"" to be good, not perfect, but just good. Because no sci-fi movies are flawless as it requires logics that do not fully exist in a real life, but have to look believable in some way so there are always least a couple of flaws. Also this being a sequel to Riddley Scott's first Alien movie, it is impossible to avoid comparison and nitpicking.Luckily, Fred Alvarez, the director managed to at least make this film enjoyable, horrifying, and intense in a timely 2-hour trip to the space. Talking about what could have been better first, the casting consisted of mostly young actors who showed efforts, but got overshadowed by ambiguous narrations that were difficult to understand. The blame partially goes to the dialogue and script as it was hard to grasp the purpose of the crew's trip to the crumbled spaceship and their goal in general. I had to wait until the half way of the movie to get what their mission was. For this reason, the exposition seemed rushed and irrelevant.Other than that, the movie had a series of action-packed scenes, including flashing lights that may affect those who are prone to photosensitive epilepsy just like how it warned before movie started. It also featured palpable and creepy details of Aliens in various forms. The climax was satisfying as it showcased one of the unique and creative villains in sci-fi movies in a feisty fashion.The humanoids were well presented through both CGI and acting to make the futuristic setting more realistic. The music and sound usage was spot-on to capture different moods along with nifty camera angles that made us jump from seats. This movie met my expectation and glad I watched it as it has been a while since a decent sci-fi movie came out.",2024-08-26

737,RubenKushalini,A Familiar Yet Thrilling Revival of Xenomorph Horror,6,"Alien: Romulus, combines the classic horror elements of Alien with a few inventive twists. The story focuses on Rain Carradine (Cailee Spaeny), a Weyland-Yutani employee on a remote colony, who teams up with her synthetic brother, Andy, and a small crew to escape their harsh life. The group stumbles upon an abandoned space station but quickly learns it's infested with deadly xenomorphs, leading to a fight for survival in a setting reminiscent of the original Alien.The movie stays close to the formula of James Cameron's Aliens, where trapped characters face off against a relentless alien force in confined spaces. From facehuggers to intense chest-bursting scenes, the horror is familiar, even predictable at times. Some fan-service lines and callbacks, such as a nod to Ripley's iconic ""Get away from her, you b*tch,"" feel forced and add little to the plot, making certain moments feel overly nostalgic rather than fresh.The character Andy, a synthetic, adds some complexity to the story, showing unexpected changes after an upgrade that leads him to become a more unpredictable force in the group. Despite a few minor issues, Alien: Romulus still provides a well-crafted horror experience with a strong cast and compelling visuals, showing how the franchise can evolve while respecting its roots.",2024-11-01
738,Dylpickle08,#?,8,"This film is an interquel to Alien and Aliens, and follows three siblings who, desperate to escape their never-ending colony work contract, fly to an abandoned and rundown Weyland-Yutani spacecraft, hoping to use its cryostasis chambers to travel to the beautiful planet Yvaga. However, upon arrival, they discover that the ship is actually a research station. As they explore and scavenge the vessel, they are attacked by the deadly alien experiments and must find a way to escape before the ship crashes into the atmosphere-and while they are still alive to do so. Overall, due to impressive visual effects, brutal kills, many memorable scenes, and a simple yet exciting story, this movie is a strong addition to the franchise and even though it includes a few seemingly forced callbacks and omages-some more effective than others- it still marks a great return to form, staying true to the original by focusing on horror and suspense over action, and placing the characters in an isolated, claustrophobic setting. I enjoyed it more than many other installments in the series and had a great time with it, in general.",2024-09-12
739,Stay_away_from_the_Metropol,"The epitome of fan service, but it ROCKS",8,"Pure fan service but also grade-A entertainment.This is the first Alien film that has taken all of the collective lore and aesthetics and simply re-used it rather than trying to do something innovative with its story. But, for those not looking to be challenged or surprised, for those who simply seek tense, gripping action with as many xenomorphs and face-huggers as possible, this film is a dream come true. While it lacks in creativity, it absolutely delivers in every other way. Director Fede Alvarez understands how to use tension very well, which is now very clear through the consistency of his films (Don't Breathe, and Evil Dead (2013), before this).I actually found the beginning of the film to be one of its strongest suits, as it sets its own world and its character's stories up in a very tightly knit and classic-feeling manner. It got me excited for the rest very quickly, but once they get into the ship it goes into fan service mode the rest of the time. The middle of the film is the only section that feels slightly redundant at times, like okay we've seen this before, we can guess what's gonna happen, but it's never boring. It's always very entertaining. Then you get to the final 30-40 minutes and it's just over-the-top and electric, it's theatrical value cannot be denied. It is an immensely fun movie to see in the theater. A lot of the sequences have big, big video game boss battle energy, and I am entirely here for it. We don't get much of that in movies these days. Not anymore.While the whole cast did a sufficient job, there is only one cast member who truly stood out, and that was the wonderful David Jonsson as our lead's cyborg brother, Andy. Wildly impressive, dynamic, and endearing performance by this legend. I hope to see him in a lot more film and/or TV in the near future. Cailee Spaeny did a fine job carrying the film, otherwise.While it's not breaking any ground AT ALL, it is one of the most purely entertaining movies I have seen come out this year. Fully worth seeing in the theater and fully worthy of all the praise.",2024-08-31
740,FixedYourEnding,Well done rehash of old materials,7,"This is serious. An addition to one of the greatest, if not _the_ greatest, SCI-FI franchise of all times. I recently re-watched Alien from 1979, and to be honest although the story is great, it definitely showing its age, making Aliens from 1986 the best movie in the franchise IMHO. Can you make something in that caliber today? Quite possibly, but ""Alien: Romulus"" is not it.There are a lot going for ""Alien: Romulus"", great CGI, the aliens are well-made and they were not limited to a certain time period or certain characters, however they missed on making a real substantial addition to the franchise, or adding to the lore, leaving it at a distant 4th best overall for me.The fact that it is not happening in actual ""deep space"" made the fear factor much lower for me. I was also disappointed in the fact that most of the movie is a rehash of scenes that we already saw many times before. The speeding up of the alien life-cycle again reduces from tension building and sometimes looks even comical. The actors are almost teen-agers, which may be popular to some, but I would rather see professionals deal with Aliens situation.There is a fundamental problem with this movie- If it was made for hard-core fans that know everything about the aliens you will not be impressed by anything else other than the good CGI. If you are new to the series you might miss on many hints and innuendoes from the other films that build tension, it's a lose-lose premise.The producers walked a thin line between horror, action and teenage movie but I would rather they made a clearer choice, especially in terms of story, it's not bad, but could have been a lot better. Our theater was half-empty and several people got up an left mid-way. I'm not sure why, since it's not a bad movie, but personally I expected a little bit more.Exact score: 72 / 100.

Enjoyed it to the maximum with all the effects from the 4d seats, spray, wind.. amazing!!!Ridley Scott being one of the producers should say enough!P.s the ending was a bit too much but regardless i would not let this spoil my overall experience.An easy 9 stars for me,",2024-08-31
743,bryandraper-55833,Great movie,6,"This was a great movie. I enjoyed it. It was a alien movie and had a good story in it, but it was just a little too long. The only thing I did not like in it was the character Andy the android was so stupid and annoying not to mention the actor of rain who is pregnant. If they didn't have any in the movie, it would've been a great movie orphan better, but if they had a senior morph queen in this movie, it would've been better it would've been cooler but I did not like rain or Andy those are the two worst characters ever. They need to add a Zeno morph queen, or a crusher in this, but I wish they had the original pulse rifle. What's the actual life ammunition?",2024-11-19
744,sawoodward-93770,Alien returns to form!,9,"Just got back from seeing this in Manchester on the IMAX! Wow! The screen and sound are amazing and make you feel like you're in the movie.The movie itself is a fitting homage to Alien and Aliens with a bit of Resurrection thrown in for good measure. A veritable greatest hits with excellent world building, lived in sets and superb practical effects. It goes back to basics. It starts slowly but when it kicks in it's relentless.Cailee Spaeny is terrific as Rain, a chip off the old Ripley block and David Jonsson is excellent as Andy, her synthetic brother. There is an appearance by a character from the original films that took me by surprise and is very cleverly done.The last 40 or so minutes are pulse pounding and the finale is pretty jaw dropping and unexpected. Without doubt the best Alien film since the iconic originals, brilliantly directed by Fede Alvarez.I would rate it 9/10 but the higher rating is probably because of the IMAX experience.",2024-09-02
745,mattatthemovies,Fun and faithful sequel,7,"After many past attempts to inject new life into this franchise had failed, finally Romulus manages to provide horror fans with that sweet Sci-fy horror action that many of us crave. The plot is simple, it follows a group of miners are desperate to escape the controlling company that treats them as slaves. They find a decommissioned space station hovering above the planet which they hope contains cryopods that will allow them to reach a safe heaven on a nearby planet.The cast does a decent enough job despite not having many recognizable names. David Jonsson in particular stands out as the synthetic character Andy. His almost human performance is exceptional.The necromorph looks as great as ever, and the special effects are top notch. I also Iike the ending, it dials the creep factor up a bit.My complaints are few, I wish there were a few more horror focused scenes centered around the necromorph. The face huggers seem to get most of the tense scenes. I also think that while the fan service in this movie is mostly at an acceptable level, the final one liner from Andy is a bit too far into the cheesy territory for me.I also have to dock it a few points for using AI to recreate a dead actor. Why not recast? Using AI in place of actors is a dangerous road that I believe is anti-art. It makes me nervous to see it even in small doses.This movie is a fun and faithful entry in the Alien franchise that takes elements from each of the previous films. You can tell the crew behind Romulus were fans who were passionate about this project.",2024-10-16

There are moments that are unnecessary in the movie and there is a lot of references to vaginas and penises that I seemed to never notice before. Overall I enjoyed the movie and people who have rated this a 1, I'm wondering what movie did they go to see. This was an entertaining movie none the less, somewhat cheesy and yes of course predictable. It's an alien, if everyone listened in the beginning of the film there would literally be no film.

Didn't watch the trailer. No expectations. Just saw that the IMDB rating was pretty good.As soon as the movie began. The silence in the scene that was for about 20 secs felt like 10 mins. I honestly thought the audio was off lol hmm hello? Theatre usher?I ABSOLUTELY enjoyed every minute of the movie.I got about 3 jump scares. Again, this movie is an alien thriller. If you're not an OG alien fan then you better book your ticket anyway because this movie is for ALL adults & young adults!I personally admired Andy's character (played by actor David Jonsson.) He stood out to me. The bond that was shared between Andy and Rain (played by actress Cailee Spaeny) was moving.The soundtrack was some. Thing. Else!Mama mia!I'm trying not to mention spoilers but there will be one alien you will not be able to unsee. I literally covered my eyes trying to not look straight at it so I wouldn't remember the gory details of its soul..Thank goodness I didn't have nightmares that night..Now, what are you waiting for?Go watch it & enjoy!",2024-08-17
748,ProctoPhobic,It's just 'some more' Alien,4,"Seems to be appeasing the masses, but for someone who grew up with Alien and Aliens, this is really very bland and predictable.They've taken all their cues from the interiors atmosphere and ambience of the first two movies, cues from the music scores, even dragged Ian Holm back from the dead, but they can't compete with the mastery or great casting of those first two movies.Undoubtedly, this is aimed at a younger audience than me, hence the cast of children, but why can't they make truly great movies for younger people. It's all a bit insulting really.Apart from the lower quality acting and scant story, the poster already shows you who's going to get face-hugged before the flick has even begun, not that I had anything invested in any of the 'characters' or cared what happened to them either way.To keep it short, this outing brings absolutely nothing to the franchise but borrows everything for a tiny payout. It's just another 'Alien' movie, almost certainly won't be the last, probably won't be the worst, as that accolade stays firmly with 'Alien Resurrection'. That being said, at least Resurrection wasn't afraid to take a leap into the wild rather than playing it ultra-safe and being dull as dishwater.",2024-10-14

It's actually decently paced and written , respecting literally all the previous films and adding it's own flavor. It's a great balance between sci-fi and action, though not overtly rambo-esque like James Cameron's effortThe lead actress is terrific, and so is Andy.

750,daniel-65836,Finally an Alien show worthy of the fanchise title,8,"I will kick this off first by saying Prometheus and Alien Covenant downright sucked. A VERY weak plot, characters that you dont feel attached to, heavy reliance on CGI to deliver.Romulus fixed all of that and gave us even better. The signature chestburster scene was downright gnarly. The drone emergence, satisfyingly juicy. And get past the facehugger room scene was nerve biting.Director Fede Alvarez has outshone he's contemporary predecessors and captured something about the Alien franchise that has been sorely lacking since AvP. He knows exactly how to build atmosphere and craft the right scene to give us a memory we wont forget.The MCs were likable this time. I think the actor who portrayed Andy the android had a breakout performance. His brutal allegiance to his directive combined with his 24/7 display of reluctant expression just makes you constantly wonder, is he more man or machine?I love the sibling bond, its simple yet also touches your heart on what kinship can mean, and lengths someone would go to even if its obviously the stupid decision.Speaking of stupid decisions, while necessary in a sci-fi film, these dont come across as a negative quality for the movie review. Its stupid enough, but not writing stupid.And the last stand scene with the ""acid"", my god that is pure genius creativity. The earlier bit to explain how the aim assist on the pulse rifle works should have been boring exposition but man, the delivery of it transforms it into a key element of the story while being awesome to watch how something mechanically works at the same time. There's so many more great scenes in the show but I would leave you to find out the rest.If I would ask something more of the shows, its not to show all these engineering marvels as just ""normal"". Colonization, giant space ships, these are amazing and I would like abit of ""curtain unveil"" when they are first introduced.Romulus will be an Alien movie to remember since the pre-2000 shows made it pop culture. Well done to the cast and crew, as an Aliens fan this was awesome to watch.",2024-10-19

It's like Alien-themed wallpaper for your bathroom.You CAN have a female lead, Sigourney Weaver MADE Alien (1979) a nearly perfect movie. She fit the role and could bring scenes to life.This ""all kid"" casting they did, sheesh. Yes, of course kid actors are cheap. But they aren't ready for prime movie roles yet!The script needs massive improvement in threading the story and filling deadspace in the experience.

753,thekidinthehaal,Why Romulus is one of this year's best.,8,"I was very young - too young :-) - when I first saw James Cameron's ""Aliens"" literally burst onto my tv screen at home in the UK but that experience has made the Alien franchise my favourite saga to date. Years later, I discovered the more adult, subdued and horrifying 'Alien', which I still consider as the best sci-fi film ever made. Fincher's cult yet disowned film has an incredible claustrophobic feeling, while Jeunet's more formulaic and stuffy entry has fun with tone and offers Sigourney Weaver a fascinating character arc to explore. The latest prequels, also directed by Ridley Scott, are solid - and visually beautiful in the case of 'Prometheus' - entries which have their frustrating moments but serve to give a whole new scope to the franchise. And then we have Alvarez's entry and needless to say that this film honors the saga in so many ways (in a similar way Abrams and Trevorrow managed with their first feature offerings for Star Wars and Jurassic World). But what Alvarez manages to do is quite incredible as he truly keeps close to the spirit of the saga while taking things to a whole new personal level. He plays on claustrophobia and intimate scares, with some terrific set pieces (never have the facehuggers been so terrifying), skillfully balancing the use of practical and visual effects, which give the film a real organic feel and make us care about the crew (though we never quite hit the brilliance of the first two films in that respect). There is true reverance on display for the franchise here and it's an absolute joy to see some lovely nods to the saga (albeit an easily avoidable misuse of a famous line and an odd choice in a famous character's return) which just display the real love for the canon. For fans it's an incredibly rewarding experience and for newcomers, a new nemesis to discover before delving into the franchise for the first time.The acting is very solid, with David Jonsson becoming probably the most loveable character of the series; it looks exquisit and the action scenes deliver, with the wacky thrill-ride of the end taking Jenet's idea and pushing it - much more effectively - to its full potential.But the reason I think it is one of this year's best is because it had a momental task: make us once again care about (and be excited for) one of the most beloved sagas without overdoing things and showing that old school film techniques cannot be replaced by any new fancy camera tricks or cramming too much CGI, ultimately affecting the actors' performances. It gave us reason to eagerly want more and see just how far Alvarez can push Andy and Rain's storyline, injecting new material while remaining faithful to the saga. BRAVO!",2024-10-16
754,zeithri,Creatively Dead,1,"This movie to me proves that Alien as a movie franchise is creatively dead as they constantly feel the need to reinvent the wheel.It's gone so far that it's become deliberate self-parody at this point.A bunch of *beep* teenagers ( young adults, probably all 18-21 ) pick up the beacon of a W-Y facility and see it as their ticket out of the mining colony they're doomed to live out life on this rock because their parents or great grandparents wanted to trail blaze into the stars.The movie lacks tension. When people die, it lacks the impact of the horror of the moment. It's just a slasher. I still remember the scream of Kane from Alien 1, or the lady from Aliens, or the dog from Alien 3. Hell I even remember glasses guy from Alien Resurrection. But after that, every Xenoburst is treated with ""Sssh, aah what's that? C'Hell naw! Eww noo go away"".None of the characters are likable because they're all street urchins more or less and that's something I can rarely stand in movies. I almost expected them to start swearing in heavy cockney accent because the majority speaks with some sort of accent that I want to say is British but I can't be entirely sure. And one of them is of course fiercely against Synthetics due to an incident in which the Synthetic acted completely right. No surprise what happens to him and his stupidity.The only highlight is the interaction with the two synthetics and ironically, I found myself to be entirely on his side, again. It was frankly put the only enjoyable part of this awful movie.I could go on but I'll end here.What the movie feels like: 4/10

And while it moved at an incredibly fast pace and seemed to go by in a blink. There was a certain rushed feeling to it. Yet that's still not much a problem to me.There are some reveals which I really enjoyed but the obvious CGI to accomplish it pulled me out of the moment a bit.And any time a line was re-used from the previous films as a call back that didn't land with me. At no point should movies do this. I think the only time I liked it was in Terminator 2 when Arnie said I'll be back.Overall I think everyone should rush out and see this on the biggest theatre screen possible.",2024-08-16

First of all this movie catches the horror ambience nicely. Story is far better than the original and it was connected nicely. Characters were managed well and aliens were also designed well. It's good how they added new additions to the alien lore by exploring more ways to keep the story engaging. Pacing is also good and never got bored during the run. Story ended well with possibilities for a sequel. Overall this movie was a satisfactory and I definitely recommend it.,2024-10-17

Nostalgic elements like the white tank worn by the actress and the bald-headed girl felt like perfect nods to the originals, filled with Easter eggs and clever reused lines.I must highlight Cailee Spaeny's performance; she brings a cute and endearing quality to her role, while David Jonsson's portrayal of Andy adds depth. Despite my strong hatred for everything about the alien, Romulus kept me captivated from start to finish. The film is a testament to the filmmakers' ability to respect the original while crafting a fresh narrative, making it a worthy entry in the Alien universe.But let's be honest-I'm still not a fan of that alien's looks!",2024-10-26

The Weyland-Yutani Corporation that administrates the colony forces the colonists to stay in Jackson prolonging the contracts of miners and farmers keeping them like slaves. When Rain's ex-boyfriend Tyler (Archie Renaux) has his contract extended by the corporation, he convinces Rain to join his team, formed by his sister Kay (Isabela Merced), who is secretly pregnant, their cousin Bjorn (Spike Fearn) and his sister Navarro (Aileen Wu), who is adopted, to travel to an abandoned station to flee to the planet Yvaga. They need Andy to interact with the computer system and they also need to recover the stasis chambers of the suspended animation for a nine-year trip to Yvaga. They go to the station and Andy and Bjorn realize that the chambers need cryogenic fuel for the trip. They go with Andy and accidentally unleash alien creatures, and there is a lockdown of the section. Rain uses the chip of the synthetic Rook (Ian Holm) that is damaged to update Andy to have access to all the functions of the station, but he becomes loyal to Weyland-Yutani Corporation and Rain is relegated to a second plane. But soon the creatures attack one by one of the Rain's friends. Will someone survive the alien creatures?""Alien: Romulus"" (2024) is an unoriginal and predictable film of an exhausted franchise. The plot is too long, and the viewer foresees what is going to happen next. The CGI is top-notch but is not enough to make a good movie. The clichés are repetitive, and the cast is reasonable.

There are many tributes to the previous film, but also the director's own conception and creation of the story plot, the use of weightlessness has become a new way to deal with the alien, and the collision between the spaceship and the asteroid belt has become a big foreshadowing of the whole film. Although the general pattern and various trends remain the same, the internal plot does not fall into the conventional, coupled with the elements of the jump scare integrated by the director of the horror film, various kinds of collision and explosion and other unprecedented scenes enhance the audiovisual degree of the alien film, and the whole film is enjoyable and smooth, and the feeling is as good as Dune 2 this year, only Prometheus.

Whose idea was it to basically remake the original with annoying teenagers nobody cares about? If people love the original Aliens movie then they can go back and watch it again. Remaking the movie not only gives the world something it basically already had, but also ""resets the timeline"" on the franchise. So what's next? Aliens 2.1 with more dramatic Gen Z kids? Are we just going to keep remaking everything forever because nostalgia reliably makes money? There's literally zero consequences for making nostalgic garbage so long as you net a profit, so the financially safe bet is to just keep remaking movies until Americans stop paying to see them (they won't).

762,fevercrumb,"Finally, a solid reboot",8,"In my view, this is the best Alien film since Aliens. It's a classic sci-fi horror/thriller in the style of the original.Just as a minimum (and it's sad that we're at a point where this is impressive) - the plot makes sense, characters actions are understandable, and the horror does not rely on cheap jump scares.I really enjoyed the dynamic between the two main characters. You're won over quite early on, and it's great to have a team who you actually care about! The acting from these two is fantastic.I can't say enough great things about the setting. Obviously this is a love letter to the original two movies. Each part of the film feels completely in line with the '70s but in the future' style that's so attractive about the OG movies. The space scenes are gorgeous, the industrial scenes are gritty and grimy, and the space station feels like it's own character. I will say there is one CGI element about a quarter of the way through the movie that does not stand up, and it's doubly disappointing bc everything else is done so well.The horror is also done properly. One of the things I really appreciated was the space station itself is genuinely scary. The characters - who do not know what they're doing - are constantly around heavy machinery or damaged sections of the station, and so even scenes without aliens had the audience tense. But of course the winning factor is the aliens themselves. I won't say much to avoid spoilers, but if you enjoyed the first two movies you'll adore this. They found the formula, and it works. No need to reinvent what's happening!Anyone who enjoyed the first two films ought to go see this in cinemas. I'd also recommend it to fans of sci fi or horror more generally, because it's strong enough to hold up without having seen any other alien franchise film. Overall, the best attempt at a reboot yet.",2024-08-18
763,kobrakai-1,Alien: Romulus is a film that mostly does nostalgia right... mostly.,8,"People aren't wrong when they say this really is Alien/Aliens Greatest Hits, and that isn't necessarily a bad thing. After all, this franchise did essentially come from a very simple premise, and while I appreciate the ambition that fueled films like Prometheus and Alien: Covenant, this is a return to form for the franchise and its more simplistic roots.Fede Alvarez clearly knew the assignment going in: this is a film that is meant to feel like a fusion between Alien and Aliens and in large parts it works extremely well at doing just that. From the set design, to the sound design, to the score, to the heavy emphasis on practical effects, there was great care taken here to capture the tense atmosphere provided by those first two films. There's even some subtle references to the videogame Alien: Isolation thrown in there for good measure; fitting, because this movie does a great job at gradually building the tension not unlike a videogame, with multiple interesting set pieces involving zero gravity, an elevator shaft, and even a strange growth that evoked imagery of another sci-fi/horror game in Dead Space.The back-to-basics approach to the film also allows for a much smaller cast of characters to follow, and the end result is a much more focused narrative. The relationship between the two leads, both played well by Cailee Spaeny and David Jonsson, is the very clear highlight here. Jonsson in particular steals many of his scenes on the strength of a series of fun plot twists: Andy is a character who is written in a way that allows for several moments where his motives shift dramatically and as a result there's a constant level of unpredictability to the character, which Jonsson plays up to great effect.Unfortunately, for as much as I love this film's visuals, there is one effect that acts as a very clear exception. Even worse, it is an effect that is repeatedly focused in close up, well lit shots throughout the second half of the film, and it only looks that much worse because of the otherwise incredible visual designs surrounding it. There's also a couple of particular cases of egregious nostalgia baiting, specifically one very notable callback line which the movie stops dead in its tracks to have delivered. It feels much less like something Fede Alvarez would have willingly included in the film, and more like something Ridley Scott would have used his producer title on this film to make sure the line was forced in.On the whole, however, this movie gets way more right than it does wrong. I wish those few things it does get wrong didn't stick out so much, but as an Alien fan I am quite pleased to finally have a third film in this franchise that I can get behind, and maybe we'll even have a launching point for more sequels as quality as this.",2024-08-23

While technically, you only need to know Alien and Prometheus, there are so many camera shots, lines of dialogue, and character references to all the films, it's a wonderful homage for the fans. The use of practical effects also gives it a great sense of realism. Even when blended with CGI, the result is still far better than using CGI alone, as happens with many other films.

It awkwardly oscillates between tacky humor, borrowing lines and clichéd scenes from its predecessors (""stay away from her, you b****"", the alien near the protagonist's face, etc.), and the mediocrity of a B-grade movie. The plot is tediously dull and simplistic, and the performances are lackluster at best. It's baffling to consider that this film is rated higher than 2012's Prometheus, which, despite its superficial and mostly unlikable characters, stands out as a visually stunning film with a semi-captivating storyline that acts as a prequel to the original 1979 movie. In terms of lore, Prometheus holds its ground and is more engaging, and while Romulus may not aim for groundbreaking visual effects, its attempt to emulate the ambiance of the first two films is a stark failure. No disrespect to the cast, but the exceptional portrayal of terror by Sigourney Weaver in Alien and Aliens is a feat these new actors did not come even close to achieving.

I can tell he really boiled down and defined the elements that made the originals great.This movie has spades of tension, lingering dread and body horror. The aliens are used sparingly, with face huggers being more terrifying than they've ever been. The plot isn't earth shatteringly original but the characters are competently written. David Jonsson gives a standout performance as Andy, and I'll be keen to see his future projects.The only thing I'd take away from it is the fan service. There are lines of dialogue from the original movies sprinkled throughout (""get away from her you b****"") as a kind of wink to the audience. I personally don't think this is effective as it breaks the immersion the movie works so hard to create. I have other criticism that delve too much into spoilers so I won't go there.Overall this movie made me feel fulfilled as a fan of the Alien franchise and I would definitely recommend it.",2024-11-18
770,valentintoma572,Returning to Classic,10,"I love everything about this movie. Te narative, the special effects, the actors! Everything its spot on: the atmosphere, the plot, the environment. Riddley Scott it's doing what he's doing at best: a pure diamond! I will make a short spoiler notice though: the android looks a little bit out of spot, at the beginning but wait and see at the show it's going further...it is just amazing! With those special effects the story will keep you in your seats...and gives you boombs. The entire plot it's well executed !I wonder how they will continue this flick further on. I hope they will do! 10 out of 10!",2024-10-24
771,cfranklindaniel,Ok for a original Alien movie,10,"Respects were given for xenomorph that they are superior than human. But last 15 mins reminded me of alien resurrection though it was good but it didn't feel like alien vs human, felt like a non alien genre. People cannot fight alien but they should only run away from them with action pack. Overall this is a good alien movie, there were like scenes with aliens on zero gravity which I liked it very much. Liked the Android character. The slow start in the movie is good and that's the reason I liked the movie and an alone movie should be. But lacked Ripley character like which valued the emotions.",2024-08-15
772,chelsonaitcheson,It's a good popcorn horror-gore flick. Bad reviews because everyone thinks it should be like 1979,8,"Reading through the reviews here you either loved it or you are mad that it's not like alien 1979.Did you ever play doom to enjoy destroying monsters from hell or did you buy the book to read the storyline? LolYes the cast is young and there could have been some more character development and essentially its the same formula of the earlier franchise's additions but it's not all bad.The other crew members acting or characters are 2d for sure. It's a bit muddled up with dialogue but it's fine because they die which is always great in an alien movie.It starts a little slow at the start which is probably where some people would have liked to of seen more world building but the 2nd and final act make up for it.The pay-off is as you might predict but the movie is actually quite enjoyable. The soundtrack is dark and tense. It's got horror elements in it and of course some gross gore that is pretty well done. The cgi is decent enough although the faceswap de-aging wasn't the best.. His face never really sits on his face properly lolI won't go into the sorry or plot here. You have seen an alien movie before right?I love the fact the ships use the old Wayland tech. CRT screens, flashing buttons and a real industrial ship.People here complaining that the cast is too young are just too old. Sigourney weaver was 30.If you liked prometheus or covenant which had next to no pay off in the end and multiple issues but still think this movie sucks I'd wanna know what else you consider to be a ""good movie"".Im not sure what people expect alien to be? It's not going to ever be alien from 1979. Let go.Calling it the rogue one of the alien franchise it not correct.It's the best alien movie since aliens.",2024-08-15
773,eanzalone,DJ Alien,5,"Yes, I understand that continuing the Alien franchise is difficult as we already know too much about the Xenomorph to create fundamental suspense.However, starting a film that feels like a nostalgia Hommage ride, in association with part 1, 2 & 4, does not quite do the trick for me. It is very obvious that this film wants to appeal to younger audiences by quoting everything great from the aforementioned parts and adds in the typical ""kids of today"". Yes, this is literally a teenie slasher in space, with all the elements that an average Nightmare on Elm Street movie would have come too. And that makes me a bit sad because for that, it sacrifices a lot of logic, progress and most of all, dignity.The ticking clock is a great and vastly explored element of suspense, so why not just use several of them? In certain points, this film sends the Alien franchise into overdrive, and in certain others, it dumbs it down to the supposed basics of horror - but you don't quite get the payoff you were hoping for, instead rather a live action video game with only little true human interaction.I was actually bored because despite the really good visuals and sound design, the film never takes a risk or transcends into something we haven't seen yet. Even the music is a remix of what we already know and when it doesn't quote older films, it's the typical current synthesizer drizzle without soul but therefore lots of Braaaaaaams.Don't get me started with the androids... They raise so many questions and go against so many well established standards of the franchise. Why? To serve as an emotional crutch when needed? To send subliminal messages to the new generation?Ok, maybe I'm just not the target group anymore and maybe it's too much to ask for a profound and intelligent thrill ride that appeals to various generations. For what it is, it's ok, but I would have hoped for something more stimulating rather than a Remix of things that I already know, combined with faces that I don't want to see, united in a scenario that's very easy to predict.In Alien 1, it took half the film to figure out who the actual protagonist is, here, we know from minute 1 - and that takes away a lot of suspense.",2024-08-18

I saw it in IMAX, and the experience was just spectacular. From the effects to the cinematography to the sound design, you could feel yourself completely immersed in the movie, which made the experience that much better.Romulus ups the ante with every passing minute, culminating in a truly insane, crowd-pleasing, stomach-churning third act that is sure to take your breath away. Yes, it plays on nostalgia, but it does so well that it will work for both franchise lovers and newcomers. Lastly, how good are Cailee Spaeny and David Jonsson in this?

Going back to Alien's horror roots with real sets, costume & animatronic creatures, atmosphere, sound and tension.Viewed in IMAX the sound is spectacular the mix is just amazing!The story is well predictable but pushing that to the side for a second this is one hell of an alien film and an exceptional horror Sci-Fi.Now the story it's almost as if Ron Shusett & Dan O'Bannon said hey let's get all four of the original alien films pick out the meat and throw it into this blender and also let's season it with a sprinkle of Prometheus.Also let's roll with that old unused Jurassic world story and see if the audience likes it. (Sorry if you know)Some character decisions are a bit well... bluugh.. she does this because the script demands it to push the story on.But the film is vicious it has teeth, it pays a bit to much homage to the original to a point where it becomes a bit unoriginal. It also extends the alien lifecycle law in excellent HR Giger fashion and also pays homage to Alien Isolation if you keep your eyes on the background sets.Get hyped for it, watch it, pre order it because it certainly is the best Alien film since Aliens.",2024-08-17
777,nfscqzvn,Very satisfactory entry to the series,10,"For me this film slots perfectly between Alien and Aliens. I love the lore and world building this movie provides and the way it links with other movies in the franchise, particularly Prometheus. It's a simple story but the movie has great depth to it still if you go looking, the execution is fantastic across the board and acting I really liked.The opening sequence really sets the scene well and instantly made me feel immersed. The aesthetic is spot on throughout and so good to see the nods to tech from the original films, also to the excellent Alien Isolation game. The balance between practical effects and CGI is just right. It's not just the visuals either, the sound team nailed it and did a fantastic job.Overall I found this an excellent movie and pleased to see it doing so well at the box office. Please do another Fede - would love to see a continuation of this story or the prequels. Or maybe you will find a smart way of merging both story arcs.",2024-09-06

Also kept the horror element to it throughout as there was a lot suspense as you didn't know when a jump scare was going to happen.

780,greg_hull,Tremendously Disappointing,3,"Alien: Romulus tries to breathe new life into the legendary Alien franchise but ends up feeling like a shallow, uninspired shadow of its predecessors. The decision to replace seasoned, intelligent space travelers with a teenage cast feels like a misguided attempt to appeal to a younger audience, sacrificing the depth and gravitas that made the original films so compelling. The story is predictable, rehashing tired tropes without adding anything new or exciting to the lore.Gone are the tension and raw intensity that once defined the series. Instead, we get awkward dialogue and lackluster performances that fail to convey the sense of dread and danger synonymous with the franchise. It's hard not to draw comparisons to other ill-conceived teen-focused reboots-Alien: Twilight, anyone? The xenomorph, once a terrifying force of nature, feels like a side note in a film more focused on angsty drama than the horror and survival themes that made the series iconic.While the production values and visual effects are competent, they aren't enough to salvage the uninspired script and hollow characterization. Alien: Romulus ultimately misses the mark, leaving longtime fans disappointed and newcomers indifferent. A disservice to the franchise, this one is best left in the airlock.",2024-11-24

Highlights include a suspenseful sequence where characters must be quiet and a zero-gravity parkour course after blasting some Xenomorphs. Our two leads get the job done with, Rain (Cailee Spaeny), our standout heroine and her two-faced android, Andy (David Jonsson).

The Remake Era is sadly not over, because that's exactly what this is: Alien remade by the CW.All the cliche tropes from A to Z that you'd expect from a ""modern remake"" are still there.Annoying forgettable young people that you'll forget meeting 5 minutes after you've met them, nevermind remembering any of their names - checkYoung female ""rising to the occasion"" - checkAtrociously dense dialogue & far too many unoriginal lines copy/pasted from previous films - checkCopying the OG in the worst way - checkContributing nothing new or original to the franchise - checkI have no idea where the 8s and 9s and 10s are coming from, but definitely not from real people, actual viewers and certainly not legit fans of the Alien franchise. 2 hours of my life I'll never get back, I wish I could erase the memory of ever watching this.I can go on like this all day, but the message will always be the same: rewatch the original Alien & avoid Romulus like the plague.",2024-08-15
786,christophe-treboutte,Fresh newstart with old tricks,8,"Alien Romulus takes a different approach from previous films in the franchise. The cast is noticeably younger, clearly aimed at attracting a newer, younger audience and setting the stage for future installments. The set design and atmosphere are well-executed, successfully capturing the eerie feel that fans of the series have come to expect.The film takes its time introducing the characters, but without diving too deep into their backstories, keeping the focus on the main plot as it steadily unfolds. In some ways, Alien: Romulus feels reminiscent of the Halo series, particularly in its pacing and tone.The CGI is impressive, and despite the likelihood of heavy blue/green screen use, it never feels artificial. That's a testament to the film's visual quality. There have been rumors that this movie is more influenced by video games than the original franchise, and while some of that influence is noticeable, there's also a subtle distance between the viewer and the horror elements, which aren't fully immersive.Overall, Alien: Romulus brings a fresh perspective to the Alien saga while still staying true to its sci-fi roots. It's not quite the same as the earlier films, but it's an interesting evolution that should appeal to both longtime fans and newcomers.",2024-10-15

To me it's akin to a remake of Alien with Sigourney Weaver, with more scenes based on establishing the origin of the black goo we see in Covenant and Prometheus.An excellent horror film with tension build up, crescendos of action and the occasional jump scare dotted in.There is almost a 1:1 remake of the Alien staring at the protagonists face screeching, dripping saliva, ala the scene in Alien.We get an expansion on the lore, especially with a bit of an explanation how the black goo began distribution across the universe, however I felt this lacking and wanting for a bit more.Once again, one lot of questions answered and another still to be determined.",2024-08-24
789,GrumpyMovieBuff,Alien: The Hollow Shell,1,"As someone who's been a fan of the Alien franchise since 1979, even after every failure that came after Aliens, I dared to hope that this latest entry might somehow recapture that magic blend of suspense, horror, and character depth that made the originals timeless. But nope, instead, we get this watered-down mess that's not only a slap in the face to long-time fans but, for me, raises serious doubts about the series' future.Let's start with the complete lack of substance. The Alien films were never just about slimy creatures hunting humans-they were about tension, psychology, and complex character dynamics, at least the first two weren't. But here, we get none of that. Instead, we're handed a group of seemingly fresh out of high school, and barely believable characters who might as well have been picked out of a high school drama club. These actors are supposed to be facing unimaginable horrors, but it's hard to care when their performances are as flat as their cardboard backstories. Are we really supposed to believe these wannabe space pirates could survive a universe as unforgiving as the one Ripley conquered? Please.And then there's Andy. He's the one shred of dignity in this otherwise tragic cast. Somehow, he manages to bring genuine emotion and depth to a role surrounded by mediocrity. It's a shame his effort is wasted here because he's the only one making even a remote attempt to connect with the audience, even though he completely butchered one of the most iconic lines ever uttered in the franchise. But no single actor, no matter how good, can carry an entire film weighed down by so much uninspired fluff.Now let's talk about the AI character. Remember that iconic, eerie synthetic from the older movies? Well, don't expect anything remotely as compelling. Instead of expanding on the rich legacy of AI consciousness and ethics, they deliver a cheap knock-off that's stripped of any nuance or complexity. What could have been a thought-provoking exploration of humanity and technology is instead reduced to a bland, forgettable afterthought. Great job, writers.Visually, the movie fares no better. Gone are the ominous corridors and shadowy, claustrophobic settings that made your skin crawl in the originals. Here, we're stuck with generic, uninspired sets that feel more like a budget sci-fi TV show than a big-screen spectacle. It's almost impressive how much money can be thrown at a project and still end up with something so devoid of atmosphere or style.The crowning failure, though, has to be the alien incubation scene. Five minutes. That's all it takes for one of cinema's most terrifying processes to play out. The dread, the anticipation, the nightmarish build-up-completely tossed aside for the sake of some hyper-speed nonsense that's over before you can even register what's happening. It's as if the filmmakers couldn't be bothered to let tension simmer because, hey, who needs suspense when you can just churn out more generic action scenes?So here we are, left with a shallow, action-first blockbuster that treats Alien like a cash-grab thrill ride rather than a masterclass in horror storytelling. It's a cheap imitation of the originals, trading legacy for loud explosions and hollow spectacle. I can only hope the next director knows what they're doing and remembers that Alien wasn't just about the creatures-it was about smart, atmospheric horror that respected its audience. Until then, we're stuck with this misstep-a sad, deflated echo of what this franchise once was.",2024-08-16

Nothing new, but exciting, good pace, well crafted scenes also an android that acts like he isnon the spectrum.It could have been more disgusting and pulpy, more claustrophobic and the end could have been less forced but it was atill not too much.Watching this i felt dedication and general love for the saga.

792,vincerobsonofficial,I really wanted to like this movie,1,"I propbably should have had lower expectations as I knew it was a Hulu tv movie that they decided should get a full theatrical release, but the hype and the trailers looked good so as a hardened alien fan since the 70's and with the ultra low bars in the franchise of alien 4 and AVP requiem, I figured my bar was quite low anyway and so I went to the cinema to see the new installment.So firstly I would say that there was. Huge amount of care and detail in almost every frame of this movie, all of the sets and costumes are very good eye candy and everything is glitterdusted with fan nods and Easter eggs.These make you smile and are genuinely good.And this is why I have given this movie the single star in the rating.And that's kind of part of the problem, because this film feels like a YouTube fan film made by a child with very rich parents.The plot didn't have to be much more than wafer thin, after all, most alien movies movies are simply a crew battles an alien and ultimately die one by one until one, or maybe a few, survive. Not rocket science.I'm not going to spoil the plot of this movie with this review, but the plot feels written by a child with no real grasp of the other movies other than a brief idea of what alien actually is.I actually feel ripped off by this movie.",2024-08-20

Suspension of disbelief: 6
Non-cringe factor: 8
Lack of flashbacks: 9I'm blown away. This is so clean and to the point that it makes the original Alien feel fully superfluous. Honestly it does not hold up whatsoever compared to this remake of sorts. Everything is better. Camera work, acting, story, editing, pacing. The original Alien movie now feels ancient and outdated with pacing that just is off. It was iconic when it was made but this CGI shows us how much more can be done with the concept. Even Life showed us more with a similar concept.Aliens meanwhile is one of the best action movies ever made so it's better. But this is clearly the second best one in the franscise. The remaining ones are either bad or just fun enough, but still worth a watch if you don't mind silly action. Alien Resurrection is bad. Alien and Prometheus are equally fine. Nothing I can recommend, but fun enough movies for the runtime and not much else.Especially the writing and acting is such a huge step up from any other movie besides Aliens that it's worth a watch for this alone. The android is spectacular. The female lead SPOTLESS. They both are acting so good that it pretty much could carry any story. Yet the tension is high and goals clear unlike in some of the other ones like Alien and Prometheus that are going absolutely nowhere. There are some issues still. The dark palette is dull by now. It never really worked out even in the first one. This movie tries to create a full mining town, but the darkness makes it feel unrealistic. Humans wouldn't live like this anywhere. The spaceships are also cold and dark. Where are the paintings and colorful robots? Where is the fun music and movies? Where do they buy food and where do they have fun and relax? We don't even see a single bar or swimming pool. Or bowling alley. Just something.We also only have part of a story. The ending leaves us hanging and it's one of those movies that could be ruined by Joker 2 or improved with an Aliens. We can't know. The characters that potentially survived clearly have more to tell, but it could turn out to be the same story yet again. As all these stories are the same. Just more horror and monsters. I want a bit new stuff same as Predator did with American Indians. Something that feels fully fresh like Aliens. But again, not Alien and not Aliens. They have been remade 100 times over by now. We now have this one that is superior to the original, but need a new direction. Action seems proper enough, maybe a bit more upbeat with a bigger town defending itself? Maybe even romance or thriller? I'm not sure there is anything new to tell here. I'm just tired of the same story on repeat with even more characters dying or us just following a new crew with the old characters not being shown. Alien 3 did it wrong too by killing off beloved characters as they had aged out of their roles. This pleases no one. We don't want horror for the sake of horror.I did love how it was basically PG-13 and not R as the director is prone to some truly nasty gore that even I can't tolerate despite loving the horror genre. Alien on Antarctica did the same PG-13 thing. But there it was clearly recut to fit this category so most scenes felt incomplete. Here everything is clearly made to fit PG-13 so when we don't see an injury it feels real anyhow. It makes it way easier to recommend even to very young viewers. In my country all movies that are R are rated 15+. So no matter the level of violence or sex it's 15+. But this is misleading as there are films like this one and then for example his Evil Dead remake that is 18+ in every single way and in no way should be watched by anyone younger than that.A final note is the stupid characters. Yeah, any even slightly smart person would have survived easily. They make so many mistakes that the whole danger is created by them being stupid. All at the same time and not one character is rational. There are scenes where they could just walk to safety with no issues whatsoever but for some reason choose to get angry and fight each other to create all this danger. But they are supposedly teens so I think this is all fitting enough.",2024-11-08
794,Sunsphxsuns,YES! GO SEE IT! HERE'S WHY!,9,"First, let me say that there is not a single ""Alien series franchise"" I would pass on, including this one. Who wouldn't want to see the next Xenomorphs, brilliantly conceived years ago by the Swiss artist H. R. Giger, as they continue to terrorize hapless (and often hopeless) victims? And let's give Ridley Scott some credit here: It's not easy to coax a film franchise forward after such monumental creative efforts as his Alien (1979), or James Cameron's Aliens (1986). Where do you go from there?Alien: Romulus, directed and co-written by Uruguayan filmmaker Fede Alvarez, doesn't try to exceed those aforementioned titan films. Instead, Alvarez takes us back to 2142, roughly the period between Alien and Aliens. And instead of Sigourney Weaver, there's Rain, an equally ferocious-minded female protagonist (played by Cailee Spaeny). Incidentally, she's wonderful in this role!There is a lot of well conceived, claustrophobic action, which takes the storyline in a direction I hadn't expected. And that's a good thing. But don't fret. The Xenomorphs still have deadly corrosive acid for blood, awful, sticky secretions, and nightmarish projecting jaws. It's all there, plus a handful of very unexpected surprises. Alien: Romulus is easily the most graphic film of the series. There are several ""cringe worthy scenes,"" which ultimately makes it much more terrifying than any of the previous Alien series.And that's the true Yin and Yang of this film. Even as you get used to seeing some of the more familiar images, opposing forces interact to add to the dynamics. And in this way, Alvarez demonstrates the whole is genuinely far more riveting than the individual parts.No spoilers here as usual, but I will reveal that the time period of Alien: Romulus takes place 7 years after Alien Covenant (2017). It is also a direct sequel to the original Alien (1979), arriving in theaters 45 years later in 2024.",2024-08-17

They are more towards their 20nties. As far as the ending. I thought it smashed it. Love where it took the story. Something that's never been done before with this franchise. And. I think it works. It seems a lot of people wanted Alien to return to its roots. And. Fede did that. Bravo sir.Now. To this e YouTube people that have reviews and seem to not like it. I always say. Watch it and make up your own mind. But. What will say is that these YouTubers are just at the point where they will hate everything for one reason or another. I am all along and I'm tired of the woke mentality of Hollywood and the whole inclusivity thing. This movie does not play into that. It is a part of the universe and pays homage to it all. And it ties it all together. If you like the first Alien I believe you will like this one.,2024-08-17
800,ethandragonfire,breath of fresh air,9,"One of the biggest reasons why ""Alien: Romulus"" was so scary is because of how well it utilized sound. Horror films often rely on sound to build suspense, and this movie did it masterfully. The eerie, unsettling sound effects and the moments of sudden silence created a powerful contrast. This made the jump scares even more impactful, catching viewers off guard. The cinema sound system amplified these moments, making them almost feel too real. The combination of these elements transformed even the quietest moments of the film into opportunities for fear. This is an element many modern horror films have neglected. Instead of relying on atmosphere and tension, many focus too heavily on overused jump scares that feel forced or predictable.Another standout feature of ""Alien: Romulus"" was its ability to create a truly terrifying environment. The dark, claustrophobic setting of the film made the audience feel trapped alongside the characters, heightening the tension with every passing moment. The setting itself almost became a character in the story, constantly threatening the protagonists in ways that felt organic and believable. Many contemporary horror films struggle with this aspect, often taking place in overly familiar environments that fail to evoke fear. In contrast, ""Alien: Romulus"" placed its characters in a genuinely unsettling space, making every moment of the movie feel dangerous and uncertain.What's more, the pacing of the movie was excellent. Instead of rushing from one scare to the next, it allowed tension to build gradually. This made the scares more effective because the audience never knew exactly when to expect them. This deliberate pacing created a sense of dread that lingered long after the movie had ended. Modern horror films tend to rush through their plots, packing in as many jump scares as possible without giving the audience time to truly feel the fear. ""Alien: Romulus"" showed that taking a slower, more methodical approach can lead to a far scarier experience.",2024-08-24
801,zenmilos,"Don't waste your time with the new installment of the ""Alien"" franchise",2,"I recommend that you don't waste your time with the new installment of the ""Alien"" franchise. It was filmed correctly, as you can see from the trailer, but the story doesn't exist, neither does the acting. Just a re-shoot of all the scenes you could see in the earlier movies, with untalented teenagers trying to ""play"" adults.It's sad what the film industry has come down to in recent years. For the sake of a slightly little better footage and computer graphics, someone thinks it's worth shooting a completely uninteresting film, without any script, any meaningful dialogue, any actors.The characters in the film were more prominent in the sequels of the ""Alien vs. Predator"" franchise. The literal repetition of lines from past films could evoke nostalgia for long-gone times, when this film could even be compared to the original sequels. In this way, it only serves to further offend the taste of the average audience, who can only feel cheated from the very first shots.Someone rightly said that there are only two sequels of the ""Alien"" movies, the first and the second.

Well interlaced plots, taken from other authors I see as poor ethics, but very well executed. Dark and shadowed horror thriller captures the mystery that rightfully fills the timeline between Alien 1 and Aliens. Besides plot borrowing, my only other gripe was the CGI used to place the antagonists face (aged) onto a body (think Tron: Legacy with younger face CGI'd Jeff Bridges).

It had similar themes but were done originally and well executed.Not to give spoilers, but the beginning sequence with the facehuggers? That was actually quite exciting and original. My favorite part is the zero gravity acid scene, that was smart and amazingly creative.

I think the director and the screenwriters did a great job, and in the movie, something is always happening, so you can't just go to the bathroom or grab some popcorn, because you'll certainly miss something important. Now, talking about the cast, the highlight is Cailee Spaeny, and the movie establishes her as one of the most promising actresses in Hollywood, especially with her performance in Civil War. The other cast members also did a great job, and I think choosing young actors and actresses was the right choice. The cinematography, visual effects, and sound effects do not disappoint. The duo between Cailee and David is great, but I think it could have been explored better in the movie. I believe the purpose of the group of young people was lost and perhaps became a bit confusing and think that part could have been developed more, and also the relationship between these friends.

815,arungeorge13,Superb entry -- Fede Alvarez was the right choice! [+76%],8,"As someone who has followed this franchise from its very beginning, Fede Alvarez's entry has given it a fresh spin, but with neat callbacks to what makes it truly iconic (yep, we have a chestburster, a face-to-face shot, and more). The symmetrical screens and gooey membranes are back, in a film that also made me an instant fan of Cailee Spaeny and David Jonsson. I feel, unlike Civil War, this is the film that put Spaeny at the forefront of affairs, giving her more to do, alongside an arc that felt more relatable. Alvarez's use of practical effects and sets really drive the point home of bringing instances of sheer terror (+ body horror) into this space station, also reminding you why Ridley Scott's original and James Cameron's sequel remain all-time greats.Alvarez (and co-writer Rodo Sayagues) carefully write the protagonists into a corner, forcing them to take on the Xenomorphs and Face Huggers with no choice. There are cinematic liberties aplenty, but I wouldn't deny how much fun the 2h ride turned out to be. The entry also takes it back to its claustrophobic horror roots, something Alvarez effectively pulled off at a small scale in Don't Breathe. I'm left to wonder why Neill Blomkamp's version never got made -- but at least it paved the way for someone other than Sir Ridley to make an Alien flick that wasn't always busy trying to tie itself to a larger plot (and universe). Romulus reinvigorates the franchise, and the box office numbers did not lie.",2024-10-15
816,mv92071,Very Disappointing / Not Worth Watching,2,"I can summarize Alien: Romulus by saying it had a promising start but it crashed and burned in the end. Specifically, the first two-thirds of the movie were not completely ridiculous: there was a basic plot and some minor character development. On a corporate owned mining colony planet, an orphaned teen girl, Rain, with her adopted, android brother, Andy, are trying to earn their freedom and escape to a different, presumably better, planet called Yvaga. They hook up with some friends who have learned about a space probe recently arrived in orbit that contains several cryostasis chambers that will enable them to travel to Yvaga. Turns out the probe also carries organic specimens from the Nostromo, the ship from the original Alien movie. Upon arriving at the probe in orbit, they unwittingly walk into the lair of...well, you can guess the rest. There were a few interesting twists on how the aliens attack the unwary crew. Unfortunately, the movie all falls apart in the third act and becomes completely ridiculous with one contrived alien encounter after another. It's really quite boring. I cannot believe that Ridley Scott allowed his name to be put on this. Yes, the special effects were good, but without a good plot and compelling characters, special effects are worthless. If you like the Alien series, stick with the original Alien and its sequel, Aliens. Also, Prometheus is worth watching, even if it is uneven.",2024-09-07

And it had the badass version of Riply from Alien3(1992) in the Rain character.Also the new Android Andy was the best I've seen from any of the installments. The use of depth in that character was absolutely genius.This seems like the start of a brand new Trilogy and I'm excited for it.

818,sandjkmail,A Satisfying Hybrid of a Homage and a Fresh Take,8,"For a casual fan of the ""Alien"" franchise, this one makes me a bigger fan. Alien: Romulus may start really slow but once it shifts into gear, it works. Committed performances from the young cast is a great plus. Standout performances for me are from Cailee Spaeny and David Jonsson. Both were able to give layered performances amidst all the turmoil. Their relationship is surprisingly believable though I wish the script could have dig into that facet even deeper. But overall, the scriptwriters managed to deliver a very satisfying script, something that's become a rarity in all the blockbusters of late.The thrills may be somewhat familiar but you sort of miss those. Confident direction by Fede Alvarez propels the film forward very effectively, especially in the second and third acts. Credits to him for being to deliver a film with relentless action and scares that I could still connect with emotionally with the characters.There's too much body horror as far as I'm concerned and the final showdown is also a little too freakish for my liking. I wonder what others think about this new 'creature'...After watching this film, I feel like going to rewatch Prometheus, still my favorite movie of the franchise.

819,Horror_Flick_Fanatic,Alien: Romulus (2024) - A Thrilling Return to Form for the Franchise,9,"A deep dive into the latest chapter of sci-fi horror that reignites the terror and wonder of the original Alien.A Love Letter to Classic Sci-Fi HorrorAlien: Romulus is not just another entry in the long-running Alien franchise; it's a love letter to the classic sci-fi horror that made the original film so iconic. Director Fede Álvarez has masterfully captured the essence of Ridley Scott's 1979 masterpiece while injecting his own unique vision and style. The result is a film that is both nostalgic and fresh, a thrilling return to form for a franchise that has had its share of ups and downs.A Masterclass in Suspense and AtmosphereFrom the opening scene, Álvarez establishes a palpable sense of dread and suspense that permeates the entire film.The derelict space station setting is claustrophobic and eerie, a labyrinth of dark corridors and abandoned rooms that hide unseen dangers. The cinematography is stunning, with long takes and slow pans that build tension and anticipation. The sound design is equally impressive, with every creak and groan of the station adding to the unsettling atmosphere.A Relatable and Engaging Cast of CharactersThe film's cast is another highlight, with a group of relatable and engaging characters that you can't help but root for. The protagonist, a young woman named Calla (Isabela Merced), is a resourceful and determined survivor who quickly emerges as a strong female lead. The supporting cast is equally well-developed, with each character having their own distinct personality and motivations.The Xenomorph: A Terrifying Force of NatureOf course, no Alien film would be complete without the iconic Xenomorph, and Romulus delivers on this front in spades. The creature is as terrifying as ever, a nightmarish blend of organic and mechanical that is both beautiful and horrifying. The practical effects used to bring the Xenomorph to life are superb, and the creature's movements and attacks are visceral and impactful.A Thought-Provoking Exploration of Humanity and Artificial IntelligenceBeyond the scares and thrills, Alien: Romulus also delves into some thought-provoking themes, including the nature of humanity and the rise of artificial intelligence. The film explores the complex relationship between humans and their creations, raising questions about the ethics of AI and the potential dangers of unchecked technological advancement.A Must-See for Fans of Sci-Fi HorrorOverall, Alien: Romulus is a must-see for fans of sci-fi horror. It's a thrilling and suspenseful film that pays homage to the classic Alien while also forging its own path. With its strong characters, stunning visuals, and terrifying creature, Romulus is a worthy addition to the franchise and a reminder of why we love to be scared.What Makes Alien: Romulus Stand Out* A Return to the Roots of the Franchise: Romulus successfully recaptures the essence of the original Alien, focusing on suspense, atmosphere, and a single, terrifying creature. It avoids the action-heavy approach of some of the sequels, delivering a more intimate and claustrophobic horror experience.* Stunning Visuals and Practical Effects: The film is visually impressive, with stunning cinematography and impressive practical effects. The Xenomorph is brought to life in all its terrifying glory, and the film's action sequences are both thrilling and visceral.* Thought-Provoking Themes: Romulus explores complex themes about humanity, artificial intelligence, and the dangers of technology. It raises questions about what it means to be human and the ethical implications of our creations.* A Satisfying and Thrilling Conclusion: The film's climax is both satisfying and thrilling, with a final showdown that is both suspenseful and action-packed. The ending leaves the door open for future installments, but it also provides a sense of closure to this particular story.Final VerdictAlien: Romulus is a triumph for the Alien franchise. It's a suspenseful, terrifying, and thought-provoking film that will leave you on the edge of your seat. With its strong characters, stunning visuals, and terrifying creature, Romulus is a must-see for fans of sci-fi horror. It's a reminder that even after all these years, the Xenomorph remains one of the most terrifying creatures ever put on film.",2024-10-16

It's the first film since aliens that looks and feels like an alien film, sets are perfect, for the budget it's astonishing.People said it starts as alien, turns to aliens and ends in Prometheus and yeah it kind of does but not how you imagine, the xenos although seen are brief and as shadows, the films budget helps here because often what is scarier is what you don't see and even during the ""aliens"" phase is not pushing it too hard and is more of a merger of alien and aliens and that's not a bad thing. However this film adds it's own elements and really highlights the danger of the aliens acid blood etc in creative ways, this film also shows us the life of colonists, we see and walk among the colony something only ever imagined previously.Yeah this film does a lot of homage work kind of like copying homework and altering it slightly but after covenant that's what we need. Stick to what works.The only downs I have are;
The actors all seem like teenagers, very hard to care about and often just annoying.The cgi and deep fake stuff needed a lot of improvement it's jarring it's so bad.Keep an open mind this film had a low low budget and achieved an amazing thing.",2024-10-19

824,bankofmarquis,A Strong Entry in the Alien Franchise,8,"The Alien franchise has taken some hits lately as the Ridley Scott prequels to his famed 1979 film - PROMETHEUS and ALIEN: COVENANT - were dense on mythology but scarce on scares while the ALIEN vs. PREDATOR films were less than stellar efforts of the Silver Screen.Enter Director/Writer Fed Alvarez (DON'T BREATHE) who...ahem...BREATHES new life into the franchise with a taunt, tense thriller filled with dread (and the occasional chest-burster).Taking place between the 2 best films of the series, the original ALIEN (1979) and the action-packed James Cameron-led ALIENS (1986). This time, a group of young 20-somethings happen upon a derelict Space Station that harbors a secret - and perhaps a face-hugger or 2.Leading the group of youngsters exploring the Space Station is Cailee Spaeny (so good in CIVIL WAR earlier this year) in the ""Sigourney Weaver"" role. She is the only one at the beginning of the adventure to truly grasp what's happening and takes action to keep her (and her compatriots) alive. It is a strong performance by Spaeny who is an actress (and character) that is easy to root for.She is ably supported by Archie Renaux (Tyler), Isabela Merced (Kay) and Aileen Wu (Navarro) all ""almost"" 3 dimensional characters that are just a little more than ""Alien-bait"" in this film. Only Spike Fearn falls short as his character Bjorn, is written pretty two-dimensionally and Fearn leans into the leanness of the character...to the detriment of the film.Special notice needs to be made of David Jonsson as the ""brother"" of our heroine - who holds a secret, and when that secret is revealed, Jonsson's performance changes very appropriately to the situation at hand.Oh...and there's an appearance by a familiar face that will surely delight fans of the franchise (to say more would be to spoil).Director Alvarez sure-handedly moves the pieces around in smart movements, drawing out the tension and horror as circumstances escalate. He writes (and directs) a strong film that brings the terror, but falls short of going over-the-top (with a possible exception of the end). And it is in the end where one will like (or not) this film. I ""rolled with"" where Alvarez went this, but one can certainly see the point of the folks that didn't.All-in-all the 3rd best Alien film (after the first 2), with just enough gore and fear to satisfy fans and non-fans alike.Letter Grade: B+8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",2024-10-18
825,almanac-39178,A worthy addition to the Alien franchise,8,"I've seen this film three times now and every I see it the movie gets better. There are some really great scenes in this film. Clearly it's targeted at a younger audience (the cast are all young compared to previous Alien films) but there's nothing wrong with that.I like the whole ambience of the film and the way there's a slower build-up followed by a cavalcade of action. The film also looks amazing. The special effects are flawless and the sound design brilliant (a lot of sound effects from other Alien films are there and it's fun picking them out).I'm also in love with Spike Fearn, who plays Bjorn in the movie. I want to see him in more films please.",2024-10-19

I went to see this on IMAX with very high expectations.I started having reservations literally 10 minutes into the movie.Terrible acting, somewhat lifted by the main synthetic character.The plot - a confusing mash of nonsense, that really made me wish I had easy access to an exit aisle. Unfortunately it was a Friday night and the theatre was quite full.I think I'm happy to say, Alien the original was superb. Aliens was even better. And that's it. All others are pale in comparison and this was not enjoyable at all.The first thing I did when I got home, was watch Dune 2 to redeem my faith in a fabulous movie.",2024-08-16
827,tarekali-19909,wonderful extension of the franchise,8,"Alien Romulus picks up right after the iconic original movie and does so in a visceral, immersive manner. We are transported back to various previous movies, spanning the incomparable original two, and further into the controversial territory of Prometheus, with the evil Weyland-Yutani spanning all timelines and domains.The set and creature designs are awe-inspiring. The original movie was set in 1979, and the depiction of that technology in 2024 is nowhere less credible. Industrial design, cutting-edge research, gigantic human-made space structures, breathtaking special effects-all are here.Cailee Spaeny has a wonderful future ahead of her; she does a good job here and in previous work in Civil War. David Jonsson is an endearing 'artificial person' who wins hearts and minds. The return of a certain villain android was not surprising, although a better job could have been done in visuals.The thrills are nevertheless strong and heart-stopping. The protagonists do not die like fools, as we see in recent installments directed by Ridley Scott. Here they put up a good fight, to the bitter end. A wonderful extension of the franchise after recent disappointments.",2024-10-27
828,liliidali,ITS BACK AND BETTER!,10,"I was already a huge fan of the original alien film as well as the video game - alien isolation. I was losing hope in the franchise since most of the recent alien films have been pretty lackluster and full of boring stereotypes. Then I saw Alien Romulus and felt true joy for the franchise again. I had a huge smile on my face while watching Romulus because I could tell this movie was made by another true fan. I saw references to the video game instantly, and then found out that the director also played the alien isolation game. The game truly captures the horror of being trapped on a ship with the alien, in the vastness of space. It does this mostly by creating an incredibly tense ambiance with great sound design. This movie clearly follows that lead, and not only delivers great visual tension, but the audio design is insane. There were parts of the movie where I felt literal goosebumps just from the sounds. The film, just like the video game, also maintains the ""analog"" environment of the original film. I think this is so neat, because it truly separates this film from other Sci-Fi thrillers. I think when most people think of the Alien franchise, they can't help but also picture the retro aesthetic and ""bulkiness"" of the tech.One last final praise - the finale of this movie was a RIDE. Unlike most movies that fail to deliver a good ending, this movie delivered the most exhilarating finale. The new creature is truly horrifying and a much needed addition. The ending makes me look forward to the next film!!",2024-09-01
829,toonarly,Brings back a bit of alien 2,10,"If you enjoyed sigourney weaver in alien 2 as she goes about hunting the alien queen, you'll love this entree' as the same scenes are integrated into this helping as the alien from the very first alien movie has been retrieved from deep space for experimentation which went very wrong (as usual when you mess with one of these). A rag tag young crew of teenagers attempt to escape their ""slavery"" to the corporate moguls by commandeering a ship and going to the supposed abandoned space station caught in orbit recently and they believe that if they can get the cryo chambers they can escape to a fabled paradise planet. Things go horribly wrong as they board this station and the ""artificial person"" from the first alien movie is hell bent on completing the mission. Lots of great action, a lot of stupidity by one of the teenagers who is just an idiot. All around suspense fun, gore, lots of crawly hopping aliens and of course a great music score. Worth the watch and fits in very logically with the alien timeline and franchise. Much better than alien 3 which made no sense whatsoever. Nothing questionable, no nudity , some foul language and a lot of violence and gore. Enjoy!",2024-10-15

Did I mention the sets? They are incredible and I would love to see a documentary on how they made it. So just to be clear this is a modern day rendition on an Alien saga using 20/30 year old actors, young and hip.

Every minute was enjoyable, such as brooding and multi-faceted alien terror can possibly be. Suspending disbelief was easy. The special effects were top drawer.

Cailee Spaeny is a more-than-convincing lead and shares the screen well with. David Jonsson, who also commands a strong supporting role. Jonsson's chemistry with the rest of the cast is impressive as is his acting and should also not go unnoticed as he even steals the scene at times. This movie is so fresh yet so familiar in the best ways possible! Closing out with a tremendously-tense 3rd act and jaw dropping visual effects, 'Alien: Romulus' has all of the tools necessary to warrant even more future installments from not only this franchise, but from Director Fede Alvarez himself.",2024-08-24

Not even close.The sets are reasonable and it appears that a reasonable amount of cash has been thrown at this, but I couldn't even finish it.The main problem for me is the cast. Not only an improbable assembly of teenagers, but acting ranging from mediocre to atrocious. One of the male characters in particular (can't even be bothered checking which one) is straight out of a downmarket UK soap. Needed subtitles to follow the dialogue and being British didn't help at all. No doubt the casting is supposed to attract a younger audience. This might work for kids more used to action video games than films with believable characters.

The call backs and nods to the originals was a fun fan service that you can't help but smile at.I know films like this can be devised amongst a rabid fan base.

There are no strong dialogues like in Prometheus. The fact that the actors are extremely young and die one by one reminds us of the teen-slasher movies made before 2000, but this does not detract from the pleasure of watching. This time, Rain carries the flag instead of Ripley. Andy, on the other hand, has shown a successful performance as Wayland's Android. It is a production worthy of the Alien series and I think it provides everything expected from an Alien movie. A very clean movie, the sequel will definitely come.",2024-10-17
838,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Review for Alien: Romulus,8,"This was a movie that I didn't even realize was coming out until close to its release date. My background with this series is that I saw Aliens and Alien 3 first. It wasn't until college that I finally sat down to watch the original. I've seen all the films and I'm positive overall. Seeing that Fede Álvarez and Rodo Sayagues were taking on this one had me intrigued, just knowing earlier works they'd done. I've also now given it a second watch to see how I sat with it for my end of year list.Synopsis: while scavenging the deep ends of a derelict space station, a group of young space colonists come face to face with the most terrifying life form in the universe.We start this off with a ship collecting something from space. This will come back into play later. It then shifts to the planet where we meet our lead, Rain (Cailee Spaeny). She works in agriculture and she has an android named Andy (David Jonsson). What we learn is that he was found by her father, they reprogrammed him and he's been a part of the family since. He is starting to malfunction though.Rain believes that she's worked enough hours, so she goes to the colonist's office to put in for a transfer. Things don't go as planned as her required hours are increased. She's also switched to work in the mines. This is what killed her parents recently. Not only is this disheartening, but Andy is attacked by a group of kids. She resets him before going over to her friend's place.It is here we meet Tyler (Archie Renaux), Kay (Isabela Merced), Bjorn (Spike Fearn) and Navarro (Aileen Wu). Tyler is the leader; Navarro is their pilot and Bjorn hates androids. We learn later that something happened to his mother which has made him bitter. They have a plan, but they need Andy. Above their planet is a ship. It belongs to Weyland-Yutani Corporation, the company that everyone here works for. They believe that there should be cryo-pods. They tend to come in groups of 5. The offer is made to Rain that if they have Andy help them, they'll take her to this planet they dream of going to. Their planet has 0 hours of sunlight per day where the other seems like paradise.What was thought to be an in and out mission runs into complications. The pods don't have enough power to get them for how far they must go. By turning on the ship to get more fuel, they awaken something. They speak with Rook (facial and vocally performed by Daniel Betts) to learn more. They also use a chip from Rook in Andy to allow him access. This creates more issues though since new directives have been given, ones that are more in line with the corporation. It is a fight for survival to get away before it is too late.That is where I'll leave my recap and introduction to the characters. Where I want to start is that before seeing this, I had friends that loved this while others weren't as impressed. I took in what I could without spoiling this for me. I'll also say here is that ahead of seeing this, I wondered if this was a sequel to Alien: Covenant, the last to be released. Interestingly, this seems to be taking place about 20 years after the original, but before the first sequel.Now that I have that set up and out of the way, let me delve into what we're getting here. It has a basic premise. What I noticed is that this has nods to other films in the series. The beginning here with meeting Rain feels like Aliens. The planet that she lives on also feels like the one that they go to visit in that movie as well. There is a feel of Alien Resurrection with this crew going to the ship above the planet. That is more of a reach there. What I will say is that I like this idea of a group of poor workers trying to revolt and flee their planet. They don't have any prospects there aside from work until they die. Taking a dark look at capitalism is a commentary that is in the fabric of all the movies and it is here as well.What I also like here is that when they get onto the ship, we have that claustrophobic feel. When the xenomorphs and the face-huggers attack, there is that added dimension of fear that if their acid blood is spilled, then it will burn through the ship and open it to the vacuum of space. This vessel is large though so there are brief reprises where people can get to safety. I'll just go ahead and pull the effects in here as well. This goes brutal with different things we get. I'm glad that we have good practical effects to bring in that realism we got with like Evil Dead and to a lesser extent Don't Breathe. There is CGI here as well, there isn't any other way to do it. The money is there to make it look good. This brings the horror which I appreciated.Let me then finish out discussing filmmaking. What helps with the effects is the cinematography and framing. That helps to hide the seams. They do good things as well conveying that this is in space. The location is brought to life as well. I'd also say that since we get action throughout, that helps to keep this exciting. Those were also filmed well, which helps. The only other thing would be the soundtrack. That fit what was needed. There is choir music that adds an element. I did enjoy that, made me think of Prometheus.There is a gripe that I wanted to bring up. This film has a 'requel' feel in the fact that it does borrow and use things from earlier movies. I'd already said things with the basic story. There are also lines taken directly from it. The use of the Rook character is another, making to look like the late, great Ian Holm. The use of the android character seems to border on a combo of Alien and Aliens with what they do with him there. I get what they're doing there, but I just wished they would have used the CGI to make him like Holm. I love paying homage, it just doesn't look good. There's even a bit of the David character played by Michael Fassbender as well. It does this quite a bit to get fans excited and I'm not sure we needed to do it as much. There are even lines lifted directly that I'm torn on, the nostalgia part loves it and me as a viewer also groans.All that is left then is acting. Spaeny is interesting here. Originally, I thought that she was flat. With this second watch, that isn't as big a problem for me. She does well in as lead. Jonsson was fine as this version's android. I like the change that comes over him when his protocols change. There is also heart here between Rain and Andy that I enjoyed. Renaux, Merced, Fearn and Wu were fine. Betts was interesting to become Rook. I will also say that Kay has an intriguing reveal. Originally, I thought it was more for shock value, but it does build to something for the climax so I'll credit it there. I'd say the rest of the cast were fine in rounding this out for what was needed.In conclusion, despite the issues that I brought up, I still enjoyed this movie. It can be difficult to build tension when you're doing a prequel. This is set in an area and time where it does work though. This is a franchise that timing wise works better than others. I like the brutality with the effects that we get. I'd say that in general they are a bright spot. The cinematography and framing help there while also capturing where this was set. I do like the social commentary that has been in this series, as it is still relevant. I think this is probably in the upper half of the franchise for me after one watch and that is solidified with a second time around.My Rating: 7.5 out of 10.",2024-09-09
839,theromanempire-1,good film but repetitive...,8,While this is a solid entry in the alien franchise and manage to bring a similar claustophophic horror atmosphere the original alien film brought still is the 7nth film in the franchise 9nth if u count the alien vs predator films and that means that we get the same thing more or less alien horror elements for the ninth time so this is repetetive.Never the less for what it is is worth your time and money and also we have a kind of a twist in the end and a clever idea to present a new breed of alien creatures which humans are also somehow involved as u can see by the end of the film.Anyhow if u love the alien franchise u can check this out as it's the best effort after the original alien trilogy.,2024-09-02

843,arzimmerman-47844,AN AMAZING FILM!!! But with a few prerequisites to fully enjoy it.,9,"My Opinion of this movie is this: If you have played the game Alien: Isolation, and seen at least the first two Alien films, then you will absolutely love this movie because many elements are taken from the game and those two movies so it was very nostalgic to me and there was a lot of fan service and it felt like a love child of those three things, plus some new stuff!!! I feel like any Movie Critic who doesn't like the Movie probably just never played Alien: Isolation. At the end of the movie, I literally cried and it wasn't because I thought it was sad or it was scary, it was BECAUSE IT WAS SO AMAZING!!!! This was a life-changing experience and definitely my favorite movie of the year. I feel for a movie that was based off of a book people usually read the book and watch the movie but then say the typical ""The movie was okay, but the book was better."" In this case, If you have played the game (Alien: Isolation) then it only adds heavily to the experience rather than detracting from it. I am also a musician and my main instrument is Bass Trombone and in the end of the film there was a SUPER EPIC Bass Trombone moment and that's when I burst out crying because it was like the Chef's Kiss of the whole thing!!! My only complaints are some tiny details in it that I would have wanted to be slightly different but that's kind of just nit-picking honestly. So basically what you should know is this: If you want to see Alien Romulus and enjoy it as much as I did then your homework is to go watch Alien, Aliens and go play Alien: Isolation (doesn't matter what difficulty it is) Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk lol.",2024-08-16

As soon as Ridley Scott let go of his child, a normal movie immediately appeared. Alien: Romulus is just a normal Sci-Fi horror. It clearly shouldn't be put on a par with the first 2 films, but with all the subsequent ones. First of all, there is not much stupidity here, even the main stupid actions of the main characters tried to explain - they are children. Strangers, or rather strangers here are more like strangers from part 2. In general, Alien: Romulus catches the thought that this is some kind of symbiosis of the first and second parts.

I waited a few weeks to get to the cinema to see Alien: Romulus. The story is relatively good, until the end. I think Fede Alvarez tried to keep some historical references from ""Prometheus"" and ""Covenant"". In my opinion, he overdid it, I can only see it if I look at some ""deleted"" scenes from ""Prometheus"". Alvarez manages to keep the suspense and many ""cliché"" references from the previous films (Alien and Aliens) throughout almost the entire film. There are also some very subtle and brilliantly ""inserted"" references to the game ""Alien Isolation"". The story ends up having a sentimental side, just like Ripley and Newt. I hope Alvarez continues with the franchise and that he really gets the budget he deserves.Very positive rating for special effects, sound effects and soundtrack.

By the movie's end, this universe feels so much more flushed out and cohesive while still opening up more questions.

853,Erictoolander,The worst kind of sequel,2,"This movie adds nothing new to the Alien universe. This makes it the worst kind of sequel; one that re-uses old ideas from the old Alien movies, which we've already seen, in order to please the crowd. They've even, rather shamelessly, added a bizarre, CGI generated version of the recently deceased actor Ian Holm's character from the first Alien movie.So what's left? Well, the action scenes are okay but very repetitive (doors closing, characters getting stuck on opposite sides of the glass, air-locks, buttons not working, we have to go back to get him, ""No, let's continue"" etc.). The acting is just horrendous.They also do something which in this case is unforgivable. They forget the defining characteristic of the Alien, it's intelligence. That's what makes it interesting. In this movie, the Aliens are running head-first into cannon fire, launching themselves towards death.This movie does not deserve to be an Alien movie as it does not consider the legacy.",2024-08-24

Great storyline, similar to the previous movies (but honestly who cares, because we all love some good old NOSTALGIA), well written characters! Most of the bad reviews hate the teenage protagonists but at least their poor choices throughout the movie are justified by their age in contrary of the adults of the previous movies that do stupid things!... loved the jumbscares!!..

856,lostlevel,"Probably the best ""modern"" Alien film but too many jump scares for my liking.",8,"Probably the best ""modern"" Alien film. It feels like a return to the horror roots of the first film before things trended towards action movies and then descended into fan service. I am told fans of the video games will appreciate the accuracy but I admit even as a fan I am tired of fan service. I was only aware of the film ones and it was too much for me. Sooner or later you've got to change. This does feel mostly refreshing or at least more refreshing that Prometheus et al.I can't say I liked everything about it, I am not a fan of jump scares yet I would be hard pressed to think how else to approach this. Once you're overly familiar with a film like the original horror Alien, you need a different way to make it scary or unsettling. There's is the feeling of peril and it's been a while since I'd felt that watching an Alien. This is helped by the fact the film seems to be sticking closer to H. R. Giger's original concepts.I'm not sure about some modern horror films... I prefer my horror films have a base coat of silliness. So whilst a giallo horror version of this with Udo Kier (as the Xenomorph, of course) and plenty of corn syrup would entertain me I'm not sure about anyone else.Science fiction wise I think this film excels, the effects look great and being working class still sucks in space etc. The sheer quantity of Chekov's gun examples were amusing. I think this film does enough right for a decent rating annoyances aside. Cailee Spaeny remains excellent in this so I can only hope if there is mileage in this they can retain the talent pool.The film still ended in a place I had expected but the route there was filled with the odd zig where I thought it would zag etc. I was worried the trailer had spoiled it but it didn't.My concern would be the sequels... if there are any. As I exited the cinema the sheer volume of posters for sequels of once unique one-off films and franchises plastering the walls. I would urge caution moving forwards. Sometimes you can just end a good story and not keep telling it until you've run out of good ideas. Though with this cast and crew there's certainly millage left.",2024-09-07

As someone who has enjoyed all the films in the franchise to varying degree's I really enjoyed this film and would hold it up to my rankings of the first films.

Even the aliens were like: why are they here?My message to the director of the movie is: Next time you create a sequel try making other smart people read your script before making the movie.Honestly I was in a very good mood before watching the film. Now I feel horrible.The rating should not be more than 4 out of 10. The story line is immensely poor. I guess the only good part was the CGI. The acting of all the actors were poor. Overall the movie got destroyed.,2024-08-15
860,lord_orsum,A worthy sequel - at last!,8,"There are two rules to making a good sequel:
1. Respect the original content
2. Add something newAlien: Romulus does both of these very well.This film takes place 20 years after Alien, so about 37 years before Aliens. The look and feel of the original Alien is very much in evidence here; the spaceships look like junk held together by duct-tape. The supporting characters are sufficiently fleshed out (if you think they are under-done, go and re-watch Alien and consider how much actual fleshing out the original supporting cast gets). The main character is not as engaging as Ripley, but her relationship with Andy is very well done adding depth and motivation.I particularly like the 'evolution' of Andy's character throughout the film. That created a very interesting dynamic.The action/scary scenes are very well done. The pursuit by many face-huggers (as seen in the trailer) is truly terrifying.On the downside, there are arguably too many nods to the previous movies (lines of dialogue, actions by characters, story beats), which feel forced and unnecessary. For example, Andy saying ""Get away from her, you bitch"" is completely out of character for him.Plot holes are relatively few (at least on first watching), the worst being the fact that no-one but a mining space-truck has noticed a giant derelict space station floating in orbit of the planet.In conclusion, this is definitely worth seeing on the big screen.",2024-08-24

I would have preferred better actors, but I found the film entertaining. Everyone appears to be a tough critic these days, and I find that most modern films get overly lower ratings than they should get. I am rating a 10 to make up for the non-sense negative reviews where people think they know what they are talking about. Unfortunately you cannot satisfy people anymore. Looking forward to the Alien: Earth series to come out in 2025. Romulus had good special effects and the pacing of the story was just fine.",2024-11-25
862,onogawasky,A very worthwhile time to enjoy.,8,This current movie was extremely faithful to the original Alien character that followers have enjoyed for many years. The leading role of Rain was a worthwhile casting and certainly it was easy to identify with her as a character in this story. And the android Andy was great addition to the story. The character was very believable and added a lot of pluses to the cast. The movie does take awhile to develop as the characters are slowly introduced but once the crew is confronted with the Alien and the other demonic like creatures the pace is really non stop. It does take one's breath away at times. The ending isn't also prolonged but is matter of fact which was well done. A recommend for sure.,2024-09-07

Perhaps not much character building but they had a lot to cram in and I welcome a movie under two hours long!It's made me want to watch Aliens again, not because it was bad for instance like how the acolyte nade me wanna watch TESB again, but because it was good so it made me wanna watch more Alien stuff that's crammed with action.Go see it and make your own mind up, ideally at an IMAX if you can...",2024-09-01
866,Donnie_Quixotic,Alien: Somnambulus,3,"Just saw the early release. It's garbage. Flat, boring characters, with clunky dialogue (when you can actually understand what they're saying, although it doesn't really matter, anyway). Miscast all around, extremely poorly written, pointless, themeless, no character arcs, no poetry to its structure, witless ""on the nose"" dialogue with undisguised expository dialogue to fill in the crap about the story we need to know, and just a chore to get through. On a positive note, the cinematography, effects, and sets are good. The sound design is getting praise from some reviewers, but it's mostly monotonous, and has nothing on James Horner's score for Aliens. It's a flabby 3 out of 10 at best, as it neither works on a visceral, emotional, or intellectual level (at least it didn't for me, and I'm a fan of the first two movies only). I wanted to love it, but it's just typical Disney trash. After the relative failure of Prometheus and Covenant, Neil Blomkamp and Sigourney Weaver should have finally been greenlit to do their movie instead, which was to be a direct sequel to Aliens, essentially voiding Alien 3 and its sequels.",2024-08-14
867,krupocin-1,Alien is my all time fav and I give this a 7.5/10,8,"I rounded this up since IMDb doesn't allow for half ratings, it's not an 8/10 but 7/10 felt a tad too low and I'm feeling generous today.As I mention in the headline Alien is my all time fav movie and Aliens is top 15-20 for me as well. This was the first movie since the beginning of Prometheus (which fell off a cliff and even the beginning didn't really capture it well) that really captured the feeling and atmosphere of the first 2 films. The way Alvarez integrates the colony design atmosphere etc & Weiland-Yutani tech (while also updating it seamlessly, probably the most impressive part of the film tbh with what he pulled off) with samples of the original sounds etc it's just downright impressive. The first 40 or so min of this movie are easily a 9/10, maybe even a little better. I was so excited, especially when theyre going off colony in the drop ship, truly inspired stuff.However, about halfway through this is when things start to fall off. Over reliance on CGI, too much Alien screen time, especially the face huggers that look like they were pulled from a PS3 cut scene at times, too much action at the expense of story, and when there is story it starts to stray from the simplicity that made the first half so enjoyable - and as other reviews have mentioned just too much fan service. I loved the little details like consistency in design, sound, maybe even Android behavioral quirks, but direct quote lifting at key moments in the film, the entire ending sequence, so many other things it just took me out of it. The second half is more like a 6.5/10.However, all of this being said, this is better than 99% of the crap coming out in 2024. Despite its limitations, Alvarez is truly excellent at the horror elements and world building aspects of directing. Outside of the over reliance on CGI aliens everything else I saw on screen was gorgeous. I really would've liked more time on the colony or more time planning like with Alien/Aliens - this film falls prey to the whole more action is always more excitement/tension misconception, but it's still very well done.Also, the preview made the cast look insufferable, and haha for the most party they were! Especially Navarro, something about her just irks me, as well as the guy with the hardcore cockney accent he inexplicably has despite being from a colony in the middle of nowhere where everyone speaks a neutral American English. Kinda nonsensical, which is weird considering they did lean into everyone being ethnically ambiguous which is what would happen in off world colonies.Anyway, I digress - the point being that Jonsson & Spaney, despite seeming blah in the trailers, were both actually excellent imo, especially Jonsson. I'm not fully surprised, since Spaney was great in Alex Garland's Devs, and Jonsson excellent in HBO's Industry - both bringing much more than what's on the page to their roles, but this was the rare movie that looks much worse in every aspect in trailers than the actual movie.My review is probably tainted by these low expectations, and maybe it drops to a pure 7/10 on repeat views, but for now I'm sticking with the 7.5 rounded up to 8, if only for it, despite being far from perfect and leaning too much into fan service, avoiding so much of the BS that plagues modern franchise cinema.Definitely recommend.",2024-08-16

Their were great scenes that surprised me, one had to do with the aliens acidic blood.Overall, i think the acting was great & cailey spaeny did a great job. She's beautiful and you can tell she worked out for the film role.Álvarez selected an orange hue as the film's defining color, diverging from the blue tones of earlier ""Alien"" films.It took the crew around 5 months to film this in a studio in mostly Budapest.

No Weavers, Hurts, Skerrits or Stanton's on this voyage.Anyway after I accepted that the cast were all teenagers I enjoyed what was on offer. Amazing FX and a great steady build up.The first alien contact scenes are great, with genuine tension and some great jump scares. After this it kind of plays out by the numbers. Nothing wrong with that, but at the same time nothing great.All in all there's enough going on to satisfy the genre fans and if people didn't already know, this is much more alien than aliens.Definitely worth the admission fee and a very good effort.

There's an interesting theory in psychology that sociopaths and psychopaths are technically not human. Sociopaths and psychopaths if you test their blood it's human, or perform an autopsy, you'll find human organs and bones, y'know you'll find all the systems and features that define a human, but it's their minds that are alien.

And it's this bit of hi-jinx that brings them into contact with a 'floating' and seemingly abandoned space station and well .... once our teens board that station 'You Know Who' is waiting for them.The errors / inconsistencies in this film are so clear that one has to believe that the Director put them in intentionally so that the audience would have a laugh:1. A pregnant woman falls about 8 stories yet there is no concern expressed for her unborn baby.2. Speaking of whom, that unborn baby somehow participates in what must be the most ill-conceived version of cross-fertilization in history. Not only is it .... 'impossible', it makes an otherwise awful film twice as bad.3. On a space station filled with heavy duty doors that can be opened only through a secret-code entry, the door with the highest responsibility can be opened with - get this - a small metal key. Yep. And the key's been misplaced.4. The film is shot in so dark a fashion that there are times when we don't know what's going on. And so when the human crew are expressing terror, we do not share in their fears.5. The elevator of the space station. The station is lots and lots of stories high. Maybe 50? 100?

This movie runs the gauntlet of everything we've seen and a bunch of good new ideas for the future.And it's done well! There are horrid creations in this that would make Giger crack a smile; there are tense relations between characters that keep me invested and want to see where they go; there's ideas from the Prometheus camp explored and carried forward with enough gusto and clarity to settle all the people who were happy or mad at their introduction in the past.It's a movie by someone who watches the movies, plays the games and reads the books.

878,tothelakethismorning,Too many holes technically but overall a fun visceral ride,8,The movie has a few issues. In the first few minutes the story moves too slowly and also doesnt emphasize important elements to the plot. It meanders to the point where some elements of the story would be lost due to the technical flaw in pacing and due to the fact that the scenes werent properly conducted. Then the story picks up but the director still did not put enough emphasis into certain ideas that are foreign to people in the real world. If something is too sci-fi or not quite familiar to people in daily life these things need to be elaborated a bit or emphasized more. The director also suddenly made the pace too quick so youre dragged along too quickly in many pivotal moments. Ultimately this movie was fun and quite interesting. This is a premiere scifi horror movie. But it did not move without flaws. Some action sequences were extremely implausible and absolutely bonkers reaching comic book level heroics. Did i enjoy the movie? Yes. Was i frustrated by how the director moved the story along? Yes at some points. I do want to watch this movie again when it becomes available on streaming services at home.

This is the first movie that has excited me this way in LONG time and I felt like a kid in a candy store.This series desperately needed a reminder of its roots, heck most movies need a reminder of their roots because they have all forgotten their ways. This movie is free of all the confusing B* of the past 4 movies does a good job of just being a plain good Alien thriller.Do I want more from Aliens lore? Maybe some, but lets be honest the main point of Alien movies is suspense and a monster. Let this series be just that cause thats what it does at its best.Alien 3 through Covenant tried too hard to be original and by doing so obscured what Aliens was to begin with. Romulus is a perfect opportunity to reground this series and thats the only way this franchise is moving forward.Thats about all I have to say about the movie. I made an account on IMDB for the first time in my life just because I find this movie important.

880,willjharrispo,I felt sorry for the alien.,1,"As a kid, growing up in the 80's, I always heard about these two films about an alien that attaches itself to some pour soul's face and impregnates them with an alien that then bursts out of their chests. I was both fascinated and horrified by such an idea but, eventually, my parents recorded the first Alien film for me and let me watch it and I was on the edge of my seat for two hours. Same thing happened when the sequel, Aliens, premiered on TV. I can still remember us all at school on the following Monday raving about it.Since then I've eagerly awaited every new Alien film but unfortunately none of them have managed to match the same magic as those two films. That's not to say they were all bad, I actually get some enjoyment out of the much derided Prometheus.Unfortunately I can't say the same about the new film Alien Romulas. I hate to be that guy but I just don't get the hype.A bunch of foul mouthed youngsters wish to escape a mining planet by taking some sleeping pods from a space station in the planets orbit. Unfortunately, you've guessed it, it's inhabited by Aliens and a much repeated formula ensues.The first glaring problem with this rubbish is the fact that absolutely nobody can act. In the original film we had acting royalty like John Hurt, who despite less screen time than the rest of the cast is still remembered by everyone, and Yaphett Koto and obviously the legendary Sigourney Weaver. Honestly you couldn't get a bigger come down from such legends. I absolutely hated every person in this new film. They were all awful and unlikeable.There's also no suspense in this film at all. I can watch the original and still be on the edge of my seat no matter how many times I've seen it, same goes for Aliens. I didn't care about anyone in this film and just wanted them all to die so it could end.There's a few nice ideas that try to bring at least a little something new but the execution is diabolical.A massive let down and when quotes, from the far superior originals, were used I actually groaned out loud regardless of anyone else in the cinema hearing me.My girlfriend is a die hard Aliens fan who still has her special edition VHS tapes and proudly walked into the cinema with her Aliens t-shirt she got with an Alien 3 boxset she bought 30 years ago and even she admitted this was bad!She'll be buying the DVD for completion but she'll be watching it alone I'm afraid.

I'm sure this movie is not perfect, but it gets so many A+'s across the board that I can't help giving it a 10! Why is this a ten? 1)The plot is believable, very interesting and something you don't see coming. So right away I was intrigued. 2) It really makes you wonder what you would do in their situation...like for real. And you end up empathizing with the characters' decisions. 3) (Without giving anything away) I really enjoyed all the throwbacks and easter eggs they put in with respect to the originals before it. So if you're an Alien-fan, you'll get it. 4) The suspense was almost unbearable! Every time you looked up, they were in impossible situations and it kept you on the edge trying to figure out how the hell they would overcome it! I kept giving up, and found my self saying ""you know they dead!"" 5) The special fx were phenomenal, crystal clean, and beautifully terrifying. They did H. R.

Why is that reference relevant here? What message do the play writers want to hint? I don't really see resemblance in the story line nor messages sent. If the writers want to express their fear of the fate of Rome, or how the two brothers killed each other, I don't really have a clue. I know it must mean something. Please, somebody tell me.",2024-11-20
883,alex-278,Really very very silly - Cleary Made for Children,2,"Well when it is all said and done this is just a remake and rehash of all the earlier Alien films condensed into a two hour film. The only difference between this and the others is that this one is clearly made for children.There is really nothing new in this and it is surprising that it was made at all. Every aspect of the film is drawn from the earlier films, and I mean every possible contrivance, even cgi-ing some of the original characters back in.At least the original films were based on a reasonable premise of a private well funded company employing experts to embark on a recovery mission - here we have a bunch of young kids, almost escaping from a kindergarten and hijacking a huge space craft.

884,mgrisan1,This was boring and stupid.,3,"Putting a well known franchise like Aliens into the hands of British Gen Z's and Gen Z's in general was so so so draining and unbearable.In the hands of other generations this might have been a great movie.Even the robot acts like it's mentally unwell.It's unbelievable.Having been a fan of the original for years, there's just a maturity and realism to the original that this didn't have. The pacing is slow, the acting is sub par, the fan service parts are just ""Member berries"". The story is simplistic and does not move forward in an even and balanced pacing. Don't think they'll be any alien again that will capture the original.",2024-11-22
885,bdowne,Yikes,4,"I'll be honest, I went in to this movie cold with no trailers or foreknowledge of the plot.This one was a big disappointment.Let's start with the positives. The cast was was well picked and I think they did a good job with the material they were given. I was excited about seeing some new faces and developing more characters in the Alien universe. David Jonsson's Andy character was the standout for me. The CGI and movie was beautiful, of course, and the space scenes were dark and vast. Ships had that great blend of run-down industrial practicality with oddly mixed levels of technology -- I spotted a floppy drive! 100% Perfect.But unfortunately the promising acting and gorgeous sets were let down -- which all too often occurs these days -- by a weak story full of plot holes, attention-deficient focused pacing , and forced jumpscare editing. The first third of the movie had me really excited to see the story unfold but it all came apart quickly. More than once I rolled my eyes and even laughed out loud at some parts. A real shame.I'd like to see the franchise get back to the more tense, brooding, and frightening Alien movies. These latest offerings are all icing and no cake.",2024-08-17
886,germanosouzarj,Don't spend your money on this trash!!!,1,"Despite a lot of resistance, I watched this super deplorable and terrible movie. In a brief spoiler-free analysis, it was an experience to be forgotten. There was nothing new. Director Ridley Scott used the same formula as the previous films. For those who dare to spend money on the ticket and popcorn, they will see the unusual idea in this new version of Alien. My impression is that the money ran out to work on what would be the film's differential. He used CGI techniques from more than 2 decades ago. Literally, it was something crude and a tremendous cinematic aberration.I can't understand these positive reviews and ratings above 7/10 on IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes. Unfortunately, the lowest rating is 1. The most feasible for this abominable film would be to use negative numbers (Z).Regarding the cast, the acting seems like a screening for a children's movie.

Some interesting characters, before everything goes as stupid and unimaginative as it can get. The trailer is also misleading, as it plays on the first three titles, but is actually hiding the last two.

In essence I found it to be a rather limp collection of clichés from Alien, Aliens and Alien Resurrection with a good dose of Red Dwarf's polymorph episode thrown in to boot. Add to this a rather annoying and unconvincing cast of twenty-somethings (I'm sorry Cailee Spaeny but you're no Sigourney Weaver) plus what was possibly the worst CGI rendition ever of Sir Ian Holm, I'm afraid I couldn't have been more disappointed.",2024-08-28

At no point do you feel scared or even slightly excited about what's going to happen next, and again especially the bad animation of the alien really ruins it for me, really can't understand why no more time was spent on it.Now all that remains is to put one of the older films on to get the real alien feel with tension and proper animation of the beast.",2024-10-16

Saw it yesterday in theatres and I am not loving it.First 30-40 minutes is good, bringing stunning visuals and tight suspense. After that everything sort of falls apart.I have several issues with this movie and the biggest one is it's lack of originality. It's really like a greatest hits from every Alien film that came before it. Really nothing with this movie has it's own voice. It borrows every idea from other entries in the franchise. Not even the talked about ""third act"" is original. It's just another version from a previous idea in the franchise.Unlike some critical viewers I don't have a problem with the characters. I think they did a decent job creating relatable characters to root for.The movie has several distracting visuals, one liners and creative choices that ruin the suspense and quality of it. I was really liking it the first half hour with a good build up but the movie doesn't hold up in quality. I was actually quite bored the second half of it and it's very very predictable.I believe that the director tried to please everyone by mixing every previous Alien movie into one but lacks his own vision. No Alien film will ever reach the quality of the first two films. It only brings me the conclusion that this franchise should be given up on and buried.",2024-08-18

Instead of delivering fresh thrills or character development, Romulus feels like a patched-together retread of previous Alien films, especially ""Alien,"" ""Aliens,"" and ""Alien: Resurrection."" The story rehashes familiar plot points with little originality, offering predictable scares rather than suspense and tension.Character-wise, it's an uninspired cast with no one truly memorable, and they seem to echo characters we've already seen but with none of the impact. The pacing drags, failing to capture the suspense that made the earlier films so iconic. Ultimately, this is a frustrating and shallow entry in the Alien series, lacking the atmosphere and innovation that made the originals so gripping.If you're looking for a fresh take on the Alien universe, skip Romulus and revisit the chilling atmosphere of the original or the action-packed thrills of Aliens.",2024-10-26

Romulus, I'm afraid has reach the point of no return. It definitely lacks the subtlety of the first or second movie for sure. Too much going on all the time without creating space for suspense which is what makes Alien worth watching. This was a very difficult watch for me.

The characters are disappointingly one-dimensional, leaving the audience with no one to truly root for or connect with. This lack of depth is only compounded by the mediocre acting, which does nothing to elevate the predictable script.The film's plot follows a well-trodden path, failing to surprise or build the tension that made the original ""Alien"" such a masterpiece of suspense. As a result, the movie feels more like a formulaic exercise in ticking off franchise clichés rather than a fresh, engaging narrative.On a more positive note, the visuals are quite good, capturing some of the eerie and menacing atmosphere expected in an ""Alien"" film. However, even the impressive visual effects can't save the film from its overall shortcomings.In essence, this latest ""Alien"" film feels like a young adult fan fiction version of the original; a watered-down and uninspired retread that lacks the depth, tension, and character-driven storytelling that once defined the franchise.

It was all so familiar, the drippy goo and spikey appendages and pretty young things in jeopardy. ""This again,"" I thought, and couldn't help but laugh, especially when Ian Holm began running things.It is a serious challenge to make sequels of a successful horror film because the audience knows the villain. The element of surprise is gone. So it takes a lot of talent-- writing, directing, editing-- to build suspense. This team doesn't have it. They just multiply the xenomorphs, and magically make them grow to adulthood in hours, if not minutes.

Cast: they've gather a bunch of teenagers who just mess around. Over all the characters are very basic and flat. There are no psychological dept. But have to say my favorite was the pilot ( Aileen Wu, who is rookie in filming industry).Story: chaotic re-shooting of already seen scenes from previous movies.Videography: very bad CGI.

901,thematrixny,Rehash,4,"After hearing all the praise for this latest Alien movie, I was looking forward to seeing it. But I was disappointed. First, it goes on and on in the beginning with no Aliens. It's teens (or young adults) talking about life, hanging out, etc. I kept wondering when the movie would actually start. Yes, I know there needed to be a setup or backstory to get to know the characters - but this took too long. When the gang finally arrives at their destination we of course a given the predictable system failure that releases the Aliens. And then it's the usual Alien movie. In fact, it was WAY too 'usual'. I felt like I was watching a remake of one or more of the Alien movies. This went out of it's way to incorporate a lot from several (if not all) of the previous movies - so the only thing new here was young people. Part of a good horror movie is not knowing what's coming next. Here, everything was predictable. Had they come up with a new spin on things (as several of the previous movies did) it might have been a really good movie. But no, we've seen ALL of this before. If you are a fan of the franchise you will like it. But it won't be as rewarding or enjoyable as an entire new approach (such as Aliens).",2024-10-18

Also it's hard to put in words why but the Xenomorph doesn't feel threatening at all, even the facehuggers at the beginning feel more threatening.But even with all this the worst part is the relationship between the protagonist and his synth companion.

Currently it indeed looked like a bunch of random gen z tiktokers were put together on a space ship and suddenly everybody know what to do, how to handle advanced equipment, but at the same time acting like bullies at high school. Too much contradictions in their behaviour and even in their existence that ruinded the immersion.The story was also all over the place, like taking random events and ideas from all the other movies and smashing them all together.

Here they need to obtain some cryo chambers so they can get to some other planet.Needless to say they end up encountering some aliens and most of them die. Pretty standard plot.Positives:
Design of research station is great. Very true to the original Alien movie. Space ships are old and used, and feel a bit dangerous. Just like in the original movie. Love it.It's mildly entertaining once it gets going.Negatives:
Too much fan service. Too many ""remember this"" moments. There is even a scene like in Alien 3 with the alien hissing close to the protagonists face. Then there is ""Get away from her you bitch"" and other things like that. No originality.The return of ""character"" was both a little cool and unnecessary and a little lame at the same time.Cardboard characters you don't care about. Even the lead is boring with no real personality.Company is evil - we get it. But it's a little over the top with the company forcing people to work for years in labor camps. The Company is evil but not Soviet Union evil.And why is the planet and people so primitive? It looks like a Mad Max city.

There isn't anything new or worth exciting in this movie except Andy's character being a bit different. There is also a great failure of logic the way the alien evolves super fast.

Just because the protagonists are in their teens does not excuse the poor acting.",2024-10-18
920,daniewhite-1,Alien Wretched,3,"Almost certainly 'Alien Romulus' is the worst film of the 'Alien' canon. It has multiple references to the franchise, so many in fact, that the film has no soul of its own. It's a hodge podge of multiple references to six different prior 'Alien' films and as such it feels like it's blundered into rip off territory even though it is an official and proprietary sequel!It is utterly incoherent and requires an audience to provide vast quantities of background knowledge of the franchise to glean the meaning and implications of the half-cocked scenes, or an audience with zero awareness and zero interest in anything but monsters and gore, or ""viewers"" trying to get it on with a partner on a silly scary movie date. To a general, average sci-fi or horror/action fan with a mediocre knowledge of this franchise the film would be extremely undercooked and hardly engaging at all as a narrative.The monsters are probably spent up now. There's nothing more to see. The human baddies are just following the same routines across the films and the assorted protagonists, the same.It is this dynamic between the aliens, the ragtag goodies and the human baddies that 'Alien Romulus' wants to focus but it botches it badly: here is another instalment of the evil corporation and evil future capitalism-colonialism humanity misusing ordinary humanity at every turn; of course they will misuse the aliens whenever and however they can. They are evil manifestations of an evil future system technologically grown out from our own evil world of corporations-capitalism-colonialism.This simplistic storytelling used to be a subtext to the protagonists and aliens encounters but over time it has become the focus of this franchise, and the variously concocted protagonist 'possies' and the alien 'hordes' have become secondary material. Probably this shows how shallow the well that the producers are drawing from actually is.This swapping of focus to the subtext is almost certainly part of the reason why this film is so inhuman and uninteresting. Together with the self-referencing ripping off syndrome of franchise filmmaking. Finally the audience profiling by the producers: where a young cast playing young characters has been assembled, I imagine, to appeal to a younger audience base after the missteps that have frequently bedeviled this series for 35 years! The old audience is invited to appreciate the self ripping-off and the new audience to appreciate a young cast playing youngsters beaten up by the evil corporation/capitalism/colonialism and its alien 'toys'.This film hasn't the merit of Ridley Scott's ill advised two prequels where 'Prometheus' ripped off 'Stargate' and various 'Star Trek' episodes, along with 'Quatermass and the Pit' and some 'Dr Who' episodes, and also mountains of science fiction literature and science ""speculation"" (or 'alternative science/pseudo science.) to postulate ""ancient aliens""; and 'Alien Covenant' which tried to bridge gaps created only by Ridley Scott and his teams' bizarre story structure choices in 'Prometheus'.It hasn't the value of the lesser instalments of the original series: 'Alien3' which explored violence and religion and 'Alien Resurrection' which assembled a better team of actors to perform it's water acrobatics and fight, chase, stalk, fight, run, escape, sacrifice, fight, hunt, kill, fight tale in the context of a bio-engineering plot.I don't think that it even has the merit of 'Alien Vs Predator' which has it's tongue more in its cheek and has two iconic alien species to ogle at.I rate at 3/10 because some of the action work was good: the zero gravity sequence in particular was passably diverting stuff and better than the gravity-less combat in 'Godzilla X Kong' from a few months ago. Some of the gore was ok. Some of the melodramatic suspense and tension sequences were handled just about adequately by the cast, crew and director and editor.The acting itself was not a point to commend. The writing and direction can't be complimented and neither can the frankly poor sound mix with a remarkably poor audio effort. The set design and props for the humans were like something from a ghost train fairground ride. The art direction for the various aliens was a mixed bag of successful and unsuccessful. The cinematography added absolutely nothing to this film with colour, lighting, or focus or anything. The editing was standard shocker stuff.The idea of a half broken, half fixed, ""synthetic person"" android was the one slight bright spark of this premise and narrative.For the mixed bag of action set pieces and suspense scenes I give a star or two, and another for the 'poorly android' idea.I recommend to people looking for a monster gore film or an excuse for a date night.",2024-08-17

I feel the director was a poor choice.The storyline was abysmal, the acting was patchy to very poor. The exception was Cailee Spaeny.

926,pulikd,Neither Everything nor Nothing,4,"In the twenty-second century, space exploration does have limits, but is common. On one of the colonized planets, a group of young low level workers is desperate to leave in hopes of finding a better life among the stars. When an abandoned ship is detected orbiting the planet, they see it as an opportunity to obtain some resources vital for long distance travel, and they decide to risk it.This is a monster movie set aboard a spaceship in the future. Other than the environment and the creatures, unfortunately, nothing is good about the movie, it is chaotic and hysteric, it does not take the time to work with the components it uses, it simply smashes the audience into everything, and nothing works.If you saw ""Evil Dead"" from 2013 and didn't like it, I won't blame you, but when it comes to working with the characters and the story to tell, Fede Alvarez did give that movie a structure, it had a prologue, then it set things up and explored things, and then it went berserker mode. This time, with ""Alien: Romulus"" here, Alvarez also has a prologue, but then there is a problem. There is a lot of material here, and the movie simply tries to plough through it to reach an ending, and that ending is abrupt.This movie is a part of a big and popular film series. The way it ties into the whole series does not make sense. To ""Alien"" from 1979, ""Alien: Romulus"" from 2024 is what ""Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker"" from 2019 was to ""Star Wars: Return of the Jedi"" from 1983. The plot that it has is made of things borrowed from the other movies in the series. And if you think it only steals from the best, then how about a disgusting pregnancy related scene? Was it inspired by ""AVPR"" from 2007?""Alien: Romulus"" is a pile of things taken from the other ""Alien"" movies whether they belong in one story or not, and it confuses ""scary"" with ""repulsive"". Also, in 2011 ""The Raid: Redemption"" was released, and a year later, ""Dredd"". In 2023 ""Infested"" also known as ""Vermines"" was released, and a year later, ""Alien: Romulus"", like it didn't have enough material to steal already.",2024-09-30

930,charlesbalsprivate,"Alien Romulus is almost ""Not A Movie""",4,"I watched Alien Romulus tonight in France at an IMAX cinema and here's what I think:Ridley Scott's Alien was something so incredibly original when it came out - and it is still easy to understand why it it still feels so ""avantgarde"". The casual dialogues in space, cool characters that felt authentic and interesting just about 5min into the movie, the minimal set pieces and brilliant new sound design... a masterpiece start to finish.If ALIEN was a song, then Cameron's ALIENS was the extended ""Clubmix"" on side B of the same record. Not bad if you wanted more of it and play it louder.With all the other Alien movies that followed and failed I kept asking myself: what would it really take to get it right? What kind of director would u be looking for?David Fincher (Alien 3) seemed like a very good idea - creatively speaking I would have thought he had it in him, too bad he just didn't get it out (...). And Jeunet and Caro? Great minds, just definitely the wrong choice for Alien.So what would have been the right thing for Alien? Well, I would have seen 3 options:1) leave it as is - because as it stands we would have been better of with just the first two. But yeah, that's not what we came here for, I get it.2) Get Chris Nolan instead of evil Alvarez and make this big, modern and intellectually mature - if you wanted to play it safe but stunning.3)
My favourite option tho: a minimalistic, kind of stealth approach, border ""art house"", ultra modern noir version of Alien with all efforts going to the characters, the mood and the pacing. Watching Todd Field's TÁR recently, I thought, ""Now that feels fresh.""Because: Alien Romulus almost doesn't feel like a real movie. I couldn't help myself but to think that I was sitting in a theme ride at Fox/Disney Amusement park with a bunch of teenagers sharing seats in the same spinning vessel. All around us the set-pieces of Alien & Aliens for us to revisit, amped with our favourite sounds - almost perfectly re-created in a audio-visual megamix, sponsored by Pepsi and Reebok and with a memorablia shop near the exit. Wait, what??! Is that Mickey Mouse standing at the cash register?",2024-08-15

Fans of the series don't follow it for the atrocities, but for the science fiction, which in this case has turned into science dumbction.

For example the use of John Holme who played Ash in the first movie, comes over as overtly contrived and the cheapest of gimmicks.The plot is wafer thin, the acting is terrible and the effects appear to have gone backwards. The pacing is comical with almost no time for any tension to build.Character development was clearly not high on the agenda and the movie chooses neither the claustrophobia of the spaceship/colony movies of the franchise nor the vastness or agoraphobia of the planet based movies.Why oh why didn't they just carry on with the storyline based on the Engineers and David?Overall, simply awful.",2024-11-23

936,unprofessionalmattershere-63752,Alien: Blumhouse,1,"I saw this thing just tonight, my expectations were high. Nonetheless, I found myself cringing through the pointless callbacks to the fan favourites, laughing through the action sequences, predicting every single plot point, and mouthing ""Why?"" every time our main characters made a horror movie decision. It seems IQs just dropped sharply while we were away. Alien (1979) is a masterclass in suspense, horror, and world building - a simple enough premise, a slasher film set in space, executed damn near flawlessly. James Cameron's Aliens was more than a worthy sequel, which built upon the foundations laid by Ridley Scott in an excellent way that carried through all of the first movie's themes wonderfully, and added it's own unique spin on the plight of Ellen Ripley, with themes of motherhood and feminism. Alien 3 exists, and to me, is the end of the franchise. Alien Romulus takes the legacy of this trilogy, grinds it up into a fine paste, and squeezes it out in blobs of cheap fan service, cheap scares (bar one), and almost nothing of substance.Did I have a good time watching this movie? Yes, but for all the wrong reasons. Gone is the silent tension of the first movie, and the high stakes action of Aliens, and in is an uninspired compilation of action eye candy. Rewatching Alien, I still feel the same sense of dread seeing the crew of the Nostromo enter the crashed spacecraft, when Ash approaches that egg, and in the moments leading up to the titular Alien's birth. In this movie, you've seen it all, and what was once a terrifying roller coaster of incomprehensible horror and chaos becomes a shoddily executed re-tread of the same old tropes.

937,milesd-96341,A real review: Not as good as the fanboy reviews or the hype would suggest,5,"It's a shame that the strong setpieces are attached to an overlong, utterly dull story about an unlikable and anonymous group of space teenager colonists attempting to pull a heist on a derelict space ship. A teenage group in an Alien movie just doesn't work, these movies require strong adult leads not kids and that alone destroys the movie. The attempts to string some emotional or thought provoking questions out of the dead-in-the-water bond between action girl Rain and her android brother Andy just frustrates more than anything. What really leads ""Romulus"" astray, though, is its utter lack of imagination and offputting attempts to resurrect the magic of the original two films with callbacks and shout outs that land with decided thuds. With some thuds so loud it'll draw an audible groan from you. The garish and unpleasant use of CGI to resurrect the late Ian Holm as an unnerving copycat of his original android Ash feels like an apt metaphor for a film more concerned with chasing the past than charting itself a new course.A better stronger adult cast would have done this movie wonders which is what it needs, the story is flat and the first twenty minutes are tedious and devoid of all life. There's a desperate feeling that the movie wants to recapture the tense foreboding atmosphere of the original and fails yet again.All in all Alien Romulus is a let down compared to the trailers and the hype and I hated the cast, they just don't fit into the franchise. They are not strong enough by a country mile. Thank goodness that in space no-one can hear you scream (In frustration)",2024-08-16

So, as far as Alien ""franchise"" goes, I like only first (a masterpiece, which should have remained the only one) and third ""installment"". The game ""Isolation"" is also excellent. Why? For starters, the story (or concept) is not an action movie material, but more of a study of human behavior and anxiety when facing ultimate fear and helplessness in isolated environment (this eliminates Aliens, all ""vs. Predator"" and this movie). It is also not a ground for philosophy discussions and aesthetic exercises (eliminates ""Resurrection"" and ""Covenant""). This movie recycles bits from all of them, adjusted for generation Z (like their social-media: everything happens quickly and there is no time to digest, since new ""content"" arrives every few seconds). And another lecture in American Machiavellian capitalism (""Weyland-Yutani forever"").

Unfortunately, the result is a film that feels disconnected from the depth and intrigue that fans were hoping for.Frankly, I'd have preferred to see a continuation of David's storyline from ""Covenant"", which left so much more to explore.If you're a fan of quality science fiction about evil corporations, you're better off revisiting ""Brazil"" by Terry Gilliam-a film that, unlike this one, knows how to balance creativity and substance.",2024-08-17

Having Fede direct an Alien movie had me hoping beyond hope for a new horror theme take on this multiple failed franchise... but the dread knowing Ridley Scott was attached made me aware that his tinkering would derail Fede's vision. And Ridley definitely directed the second half of this movie without any doubt. The first half of this movie has Fede DNA all over it and I would give the first half a 8 out of 10... the second half is beyond any doubt Scott and I would give it a zero out of ten. Ridley Scott needs to be removed from any input when it comes to the Alien franchise. Even the ending is stolen from Alien resurrection with his Alien hybrid replacing the Ripley hybrid.

944,cyguration,"Started Fantastic, But Got Dumber By The Literal Minute",5,"The premise of this one actually justified why having young people in the cast might make sense: off-worlders struggling in a mining colony where they're seemingly indebted for life to Weyland wanting to escape by stealing cryopods so they can make the leap to another world? All right, I can buy that... (for a dollar).But here's the rub, these kids want to steal the cryopods from a decommissioned Weyland space station about to crash into asteroids. That premise along now degrades the story, because supposedly there are still some important materials on the station that Weyland wants, yet for some odd reason they never bothered to send a crew to check on the station or even see if there was anything worth salvaging.And to that, the original premise now seems silly, because if they were going to go that route with the Weyland station, then why not have it based around a disposable salvaging crew sent to retrieve the goods with some minor protection by super-secretive Weyland security forces to ensure they get the job ""done""? That would have made for a far more plausible scenario.But it doesn't end there -- obviously some xenos are onboard the decommissioned station. I can sort of buy that... (but not for a dollar).But it doesn't end there -- the young people who go aboard make some dumb mistakes, and only one of them is competent, Tyler.But it doesn't end there -- they keep making dumb mistakes or strange decisions and this costs everybody their lives one way or another.So now we're back to horror movie 101 antics that were common place in teen slashers from the 1980s.-sigh-But it doesn't end there -- the xenos in this have really strange behavior. They are super dangerous stalkers one second, and weirdly apprehensive the next, for literally no good reason. They are very effective at disposing or incapacitating some characters, but then super ineffective or completely dumb the next, only when the plot calls for it.Gone is the non-stop threatening nature they presented in the original trilogy , or heck, even Aliens: Resurrection, where -- despite the film's glaring flaws -- at least the xenos were consistently threatening the entire film and had believable behavioral patterns.Here, it just makes no sense. And the first half of the film seems like a completely different movie from the second half. They also didn't seem to really know where to go with it in order to pad out the runtime, so there are some weird choices that the characters make in order to dispose of them and create some really unnecessary and frankly unsatisfying action sequences.I have not read any of the other reviews but I imagine there are a bunch of people defending the ""strong female characters"" unnecessarily so and championing the lead as the ""next Ripley"". It's a tale that's quite old, mostly told by a bunch of people constantly vying for validation and attention from their female peers (newsflash: online servitude to the female species will not result in more attention... or a girlfriend)All of the ridiculous antics, however, lead into a third-act that not only drags on too long but has some major plot-hole inconsistencies (non-spoiler reminder: if you make it to the end, just remember that acid dropped onto the floor and it was never sealed. Kind of makes you think... yeah?)They also retread both Alien and Aliens but in very unsatisfactory ways. Tried to mimicking the action and set pieces from both films, but without the logical consistency or grounded realism of either film.In this regard, I will say this: the set designs are unparalleled. I have not seen a sci-fi movie with set designs as realistic and realized as this film in a long, long, long, long time. I loved all of that. The focus on the retro grunge-punk mechanisms really made the world feel weighty and logical.I also have to give major props for all of the procedural processes required to get things done. Sealing airlocks, decompressing rooms, security clearances, wearing oxygen masks, going through the process of turning on power and all of those little things. It added so much to the film.In that regard, the film is leaps and bounds better than Prometheus and Covenant when it comes to the logistical presentation. However, when it comes to the plot, this film just completely falls apart after the first half and keeps falling apart with one nonsensical sequence after another. At the end of it all, I just didn't really care, wasn't actually rooting for anyone to make it out, and was tired of all of the bombastic ""edge of your seat"", last-second antics for survival that made it all feel so contrived.Compared to the first film, which managed to maintain its intensity and logical cohesion, and compared to the break-neck pace of the second film, Romulus falls absolutely flat.As an entertainment spectacle, I enjoyed it more than Aliens 3, but Aliens 3 is a far superior film just in terms of characterizations, realism, and sensibility. I enjoyed it less than Aliens: Resurrection all the way around. And it's only mildly better than Covenant, but an argument could be made either way as to whether it's better or worse than Prometheus.Love the director, love his style, love the set designs, but was not a fan of the movie and all its logical inconsistencies.",2024-10-23
945,ronniehrubin,Disappointed,3,"This movie takes place between Alien and Aliens. Being a fan of the series, I decided to take the plunge and see it at a theater instead of waiting for it to stream. Big mistake! Yes, it's exciting, but the story is just a retread of Alien and, of course, not nearly as well done. And this movie offers nothing to the series. Maybe the writers should have reconsidered changing the location and time and had it take place just before the xeno's take over the mining plant. (Kind of like how ""Rogue One"" finished at the beginning of ""A New Hope"".) Except for all the easter eggs, there was nothing worth watching. Wait until it streams to watch.",2024-09-04

Alien, and Aliens, and Prometheus set the bar and everthing since then has been an attempt to capture that same feeling within the movies and the rest have been true crap.This was an action movie, but it still just follows the same old plot. Crew boards dangerous ship, unleash monster, everyone dies but one sole survivor.There was just nothing special about this at all. Very little if any character development, and a story that actually was very similar to Alien Resurrection. The movie just doesn't have anything truly redeeming and your care for the characters to live is very lacking.Sadly they have been milking off the brand for years now.

And as always the aliens are total creepy bastards.The worst thing about the story is that they always make the same mistakes. Wayland should stop collecting dead aliens and clone them.

949,paulwalsh-33212,It could have been great,5,"I love alien films, since Alien 3 i've seen them all at the cinema. I had big expectations for this one and it started promisingly, the effects are great and the world they created was atmospheric with its own visual style. I didn't mind the younger unfamiliar cast, it seemed something new.Once the film got going I soon found the characters dull with nowhere near as much depth as those in Alien, Aliens or Aliens 3. You cant beat the double act of Yaphet Koto and Harry Dean Stanton in the original...there was nothing even close in this film, although the acting was ok they were disappointing, shallow characters.The music has always played a major part in my favourite alien films, the haunting soundtracks from Gerry Goldsmith and James Horner especially. The music in this film seemed to be an afterthought, sometimes borrowing snippets of music from previous films. The music was a massive let down, the soundtrack to Prometheus and Covenant were far superior.There were some good action sequences and what was happening around and outside of the ship was exciting....but...the rehashing of older films, borrowing lines and music was a big mistake, unforgivable. The film had enough to give it, its own character, but the borrowed lines I found unbearable to listen to, so cheesy. I came away from the film feeling like id watched a fan made film. The fact that it couldn't be its own original story was a massive letdown. Because of this Alien Romulous rates pretty low down the scale. It had so much potential but I dont think it will be one that will stand the test of time.",2024-09-09
950,TheAnimalMother,Alien: Brainlus,2,"This is, or at least it seemed as if it was made for children. Something aimed at the 8 to 10 year old audience or similar. If a teenage Miley Cyrus came out singing in the middle of the film, it would've actually seemed fairly normal, or at least not totally unexpected at that point. The amount of Alien gore almost seemed weird because of how paint by numbers the film otherwise was. The lack of creativity in Hollywood these days is almost as alarming as, the amount of censorship this very site and many other popular sites have in more present times. Sometimes I find myself wondering, has China secretly, (Or even not so secretly) already captured most of our governments and corporations? That's probably not such an original thought either. Just listen to the corporate news, these crazy conspiracy theorists are everywhere these days.There's nothing new here, certainly nothing worth talking about anyway. A terrible film, perhaps the worst of the already fairly bad franchise. Just forget it after the first two films. This film was not only mostly devoid of brains, but also lacked any genuine feeling heart and soul.2/10.",2024-09-22
951,fostrhod,"Scooby Doo in Space, AKA Space Goonies.",2,"Alien: Romulus 2024. Here is another in the ever decreasing in popularity, of the Alien franchise . Once you pop in the word franchise, you realise it going to be further removed from the original and just an excuse to rake in the cash. Think you'll agree?Its sales pitch is pretty clear of its potential audience ""A group of young space colonizers come face to face with the most terrifying life-form in the universe while scavenging the deep ends of a derelict space station"".So we get Scooby Doo in space, a few Freds , a Daphne (pregnant no less) Shaggy's and a bunch of Velmas' with a Scooby (Andy the Android) to save the say, Needless to say it is like its predecessors a feminist movie, with a Daphne fighting against the odds and the big bad beasty to save the day. Those meddling kids.Throw in a nasty man from the corporation a CGid Ian Holm (RIP) and the most comical Alien baby (that's were the Goonies analogy comes in, its Sloth in space).There is an element of ageism in my review, I'm sure the cast are all still in college (drama college) so to have the skills and experience to fly these big mudders in space seems silly.So you get a sci fi aimed at the teen market, it is embarrassing and destroys any semblance of credibility especially when the female lead wanders about in her pants barefooted fighting acid spilling aliens....
That's a sexist perspective, I know Sigourney Weaver did something similar, but this is just silly.Yes I do like sci fi, so my opinion isn't totally without warrant.The Thing, Dark Star, Silent Running, & the recent Spaceman come to mind, along with numerous post apocalyptic doom laden epics.I will return to the stellar cast of the original sat around the dining table, on the Nostromo talking through what they have just witnessed, when out pops from John Hurt's stomach, Geiger's Alien.

I would say ironically Andy was the most humane and complex one.The Xenomorphs suddenly could be easily killed in masse by an untrained girl, meanwhile in previous movies one could wreak havoc alone.The whole movie was a bad joke and cash grab living off the franchise name.",2024-11-16

Also, other character who you know to be clueless and incompetent.The film's pacing is slow and meandering, with characters often making baffling decisions that defy logic. For example, there's the character who dies early, hence, that's the reason why leaving the rest of the crew stranded - so, the horror journey begins.The film's visuals are impressive, but they can't save it from its weak narrative. The characters' actions are often ridiculous and unbelievable, and the plot is full of holes.Overall, Alien: Romulus is a disappointing addition to the franchise.

966,georgejones-93696,Another terrible Alien film,1,"The first words that came out of my mouth after leaving the theatre, what a load of rubbish!Don't get me wrong, the film had some slightly scary, eerie, and creepy moments that made me jump, but I'm not sure it's as good as the 1st or 2nd films which are still to this day the best. I feel like it's down there with all the other Alien films including the prequels which didn't do so great. About half way through the film I got really bored because nothing serious was happening at all.The best way I can describe this movie is its Prometheus 3 with all the recurring elements from the prequels such as the black goo (Pathogen) makin a return, but also features additional nostalgic segments and all the old memoirs and lines from all of Ridley's story.I had such high hopes but the movie didn't live up to my following expectations:1: the acting was very bland. I found it hard to really like nearly all characters, both main and supporting. I even actually found it hard to understand what some of them were saying like the character Bjorn played by Spike Fearn, could not understand his accent one bit, and I'm British, so I should be able to understand what they were saying but I just couldn't. Actors could have been better or just hired better actors maybe.2: There were only 2 actors in this movie I thought did a good job than all the rest! David Jonsson and Robert Bobroczkyi. I admired what David Jonsson did with the character Andy, and felt like his role in the film was definitely unique. However, I have principles and morals that go against the idea of humans and robots or AI co-existing and living together, especially in the real world. I also enjoyed Robert Bobroczkyi's performance as the Offspring hybrid at the end. I do think the design of this breed of xeno could have been better, it could have looked a bit more xeno like rather than a human. Overall, I admire how Robert brought this creature to life and I think he did a good job. Those are the only 2 actors in the movie that did a way better job than all the others!3: As I said up the top, this film felt like it was solely on a bunch of homages to the original films. All the old memoirs and lines from the old films and even the games are used in this movie again, such as Ian Holm's final line in Alien ""I can't lie to you about your chances, but you have my sympathies"". Also, the elevator scene where David kills the Xenomorph and says ""Get away from her you B**ch"" from Aliens. Why? Why did they use that old line again? Why couldn't they come up with something new and better than that! I would have liked this movie to have been more original and more creativity, maybe some new lines instead of the iconic old ones. Can't keep overdoing it, otherwise it gets boring.4. This film also seems to have recreated old iconic scenes from the previous films as well as the old iconic bits of dialogue. I said before, I liked Robert Bobroczkyi's performance as the Offspring during the final battle of the film, but this whole sequence reminded me of the Newborn from Alien Resurrection. The birth of the creature and it's death are slightly different from Ressurection's but still very similar.5: the storyline was pretty bad, very basic as well. I knew very well who was going to live by the end of the movie and I knew who was going to die. If they hadn't had teased so much in the trailer like the chestburster scene, it would have been more ominous as to who the xenomorph host would be.6: in the beginning of the movie, or like the first 10 - 15 minutes of the movie we didn't get to see more of the characters life on this communist mining planet, we just meet our characters who each have silly plot points in the movie and go straight into space, nothing else. I wanted more character development, character arcs.7: some of the scenes felt like they were rushed and fast paced. It's like they tried to fit so much into the film but couldn't spend too much time exploring everything into more detail so they just rushed through it all. I wanted to see more of what it was like working in the mines on the communist planet, or how about Big Chaps return from Alien (1979) and his killing spree on the Romulus. I'm gutted they also Big Chap offscreen, felt like a complete waste of potential! If this movie was longer than just 2 hours, we could have seen so much more!8: not sure how I felt about the music in all honesty. It does add to the atmosphere which is what I like about most music in horror movies, is that music and sound can setup the tone and the atmosphere of a particular location or scene. However, most of the time in the movie I couldn't properly hear what characters were saying when the music was playing.All in all, in my honest opinion:
This is a very cheap film that was made through both cheap and poor production and filming. This could have been better, it should have been better, but rushing, lack of character development, and no creativity can ruin everything. I don't expect anyone to agree with me, this is just how I felt when watching the movie.",2024-08-22

But that has changed with this one, which is all too respectful an homage to the first film, full of too-knowing references and reprised lines; and yet, if it was meant as just a fun ride in Alien World, it needed to be less grungy and more camp. The only major difference is the replacement of a cast which was perhaps little known, but consisted of actors of real presence and stature, with a load of of little teenage herberts (and I'm not talking about physical stature, although the cast of this one does seem remarkably diminutive). It comes to something when by far the most compelling performance is that of Ian Holm's AI avatar, literally downloaded.It utterly lacks tension and thrills; they don't succeed in taking the sense of staleness off the familiar way that everything unfolds. You're almost rooting for the aliens (and it's curious that after 45 years, despite all the supposed advances in visual effects, the creature in the original film is still creepier and scarier than any of his successors).

Then it all went quickly downhill thereafter, with hackneyed story beats and script ('Get away from her, you...', unlikeable characters and cast, and a completely unnecessary return of the late great Ian Holm, portrayed by woeful CGI, and somehow even more dire dialogue airlifted straight out of the first Alien movie. Alas, the success of this at the cinema (yes, I played my part, unfortunately) is spawning a sequel.

975,milmar-55387,Alien Romulus is more like dumbmulus,3,"Boy oh boy what a mess this one was... Romulus is far worse than Covenant, going even further down the rabbit hole with absolutely predictable story, amateur acting (to say at least), and more plot holes than universe has stars.I mean Covenant was bad and predictable but it had some storyline, decent plots, something to hold on to. This, on the other hand, has absolutely nothing.This was painful to watch and as a true fan of the franchise I must say I'm totally disappointed.At this point, it's fair to say that we shouldn't expect to ever see another Alien movie as good as even the fourth one was. This is so vague, washout out, and boring that it brings tears to my eyes.If the filmmakers think that showing flashy scenes of xenomorphs being what they are with some ""scary"" music is enough to make a movie, they should be out of business asap.That's not how you set the stage for a good movie. I think it's safe to say that Alien franchise is dead and there's no combing back. Alien : Debacle is all the proof you need.

Analogue TVs all around, levers, etc. Etc. Etc.I'm not sure why the movie has such a high rating here on IMDB. It's not science, it's a weird mythology.",2024-11-02

They tried to make an original movie by doing the same thing every movie before did but do it more poorly. Have kids run around but act mature enough to handle a situation and not be scared like kids would be. Yeah just have mature adults. Every single call back to the other movie was so cringing because it was done so horribly, ruining that moment of that was a good scene.

978,Tweetienator,Alien: Okay - Kindergarten in Trouble,4,"While we do get some solid action sequences, Alien: Romulus is, in my opinion, by far the weakest entry in the franchise. First of all, we have a young crew with all the cringe-worthy behavior (think Gen Z in space or something like that), and second, the story itself is, well, nothing new at all. I don't know how many times I've watched a horror, western, action, war, or sci-fi movie with the motif of 'treasure hunters' getting into serious trouble. While I like Fede Álvarez's works Don't Breathe (although Don't Breathe 2 is weaker in comparison) and the remake of Evil Dead, his vision of Alien is the most conventional of all Alien movies. Romulus is not bad, but it is nowhere near the quality of the other movies, either in story, production or acting. I'm not the biggest fan of Scott's Prometheus and especially Covenant, but those movies are still way better and more interesting than Romulus, which mostly reminds me of just rehashing old ideas with a smaller budget and less skilled actors. Verdict: Watchable for fans of the franchise, but I'm pretty sure most won't watch Romulus a second time. And why they decided to assemble a kindergarten for a crew, I will never understand.",2024-09-03

(who knows how the producer will pervert the xenomorph). Although the acting, actors and script are horrible, the worst part is the terrible audio - everything from badly modulated volume, cheesy jump scares, and a poorly placed themic music spam.The only redeeming quality was the set design which was nice, but watching the alien franchise go so far downhill was just sad.Don't reward Hollywood with your money. Just wait for this to come to streaming.If you are new to the franchise, then do not watch this one first. Who ever made this movie has very little skill and even less respect for this great franchise.Also, pretty sure all the reviews above 6 and 7 are bods. Save you money.",2024-09-03
981,dinosbacsi-22334,Very bad rip-off of the originals,3,"Such a badly written movie and a slap in the face for Alien fans. The movie is badly written, full of issues and completely ignores basic xenomorph lore.The atmosphere and the fanserive is there, I'll give it that. Nice visuals, good references to the original Alien movie and the Alien Isolation game. But that's about it.The concept of the story wouldn't be bad, but the execution is horrible. It is full of technical and logical flaws. Objects automatically center themselves in a room when in zero gravity, like it is some badly made cartoon. Elevator in a SPACE STATION that doesn't work in zero gravity. Spaceship stops in space when the thrusters go out and starts falling back into debris ring for no reason. Chestbuster develops inside host in under mere minutes, then develops into full grown drone also in just 5 minutes. The list could go on.Story wise the whole movie feels like someone just watched the previous Alien movies and thought ""wow, cool, I will make a movie that's just like these ones!"" - and they really did just that. Just copied the previous movies without adding any value or it making sense. The star of the movie, the new xenomorph design, also just barely makes a 15 minutes appearance at the end in very badly written and lame fight scene.",2024-10-23

It took forever to get going in the first place. The jump scares just weren't in it either. It also felt like they tried to copy a lot from previous Alien movies it just didn't work for us as a party of 6 people.

Kinda reminds me of that dreadful Shining sequel Dr Sleep, bombarding the viewer with half-baked sound bites from films gone by. Did the android really say ""Get away from her you bitch""?? There was even a sloppy attempt of Ripley gearing herself up with a special gun but it doesn't quite work with a seemingly 15 year old girl.Oh and yes, to keep the Alien fanboys and girls happy we have to mention the Xenomorph. This was a throw away comment by Gorman that Vasquez rightly responded ""a what?!?"" But has since created content careers for boggle eyes YouTubers and their cringeworthy Xenomorph obsession.

984,greensurvivors,Disappointing Voyage,3,"Romulus* promised to reignite the franchise with fresh faces and a gripping narrative. Sadly, it falls flat, stumbling over its own ambitious goals thanks to lackluster performances and poor character development.One of the film's most glaring issues is the casting of its young actors. While the intent to appeal to a younger audience is understandable, the execution is abysmal. The performances across the board feel unnaturally stilted. These actors appear to struggle even with the most basic emotional scenes, often teetering on the edge of being more irritating than engaging. Instead of immersing me in their characters' struggles, I found myself cringing at their attempts to portray fear, excitement, and even camaraderie.The dialogues, which could have been tools for character development, come off as clumsy and forced. Due to the actors' inability to deliver their lines convincingly, crucial plot moments are undermined, leaving audiences feeling disconnected from the story. For instance, pivotal scenes meant to evoke tension instead generate laughter, not because of humor, but due to the sheer awkwardness of the performances. Moments that should have been filled with dread and suspense are punctured by exaggerated, over-the-top reactions that seem more suited for a different genre altogether.In conclusion, *Alien: Romulus* severely misses the mark, mainly due to its cast's inability to deliver performances that are both engaging and believable. The relics of rich franchise history are present, but they drown in a sea of poor acting choices, awkward dialogue, and clumsy direction. It's disappointing to witness a resurgence of a beloved franchise be undermined by these missteps. In a world attuned to the nuances of good storytelling, *Alien: Romulus* stands as a cautionary tale on the importance of casting and character development. Here's hoping future installments learn from this misfire.",2024-10-31

You see this review is like the movie, too short in substance so it blathers on to get the minimum required length. I would have been more entertained watching Jonesy clean himself for two hours.

986,whitetowel-74786,Beam me up SCOTTY!,3,"Oh boy! It really is time to put the downward spiralling Alien franchise into permanent hyper-sleep now. After 7 outings It's turning into a worn-out parody of itself, as this latest pointless dirge proves.Not only is the story in 'Romulus' an old hat mish-mash, the whole thing is like a 'spot the old lines' and plots homage to its more illustrious predecessors. What really sends this one into the deep space abyss though is its lacklustre cast - there are no big names (other than a bizarrely resurrected CGI/AI incarnation of Ian Holm) to carry it, while the main android character (and yes, he's black) is really bland, annoying and wholly uninspiring. Indeed there is little character depth, intensity or emotion on show for the viewer to engage with.Meanwhile, there are way too many face-huggers and Alien creatures running around while the story itself takes forever to get going... unlike the creatures, who literally take minutes to ingest into a host and fully grow into the enduring HR Giger xenomorphs we love to hate!The only saving graces here are some nicely rendered sets, a decent atmospheric soundtrack and some suitably gory take-outs - everything else is as fresh and exciting as old Logans Run tv re-runs.Admittedly, following on from the downward trajectory of the series I wasn't expecting much, but i was expecting more than 'Romulus' has to offer... it sucks.Ah well, back to the first three classics in the box set it is then.

987,helloheather30,Oh dear! Sorely disappointed!,5,"Having been a fan of the original trilogy and Prometheus, we were sorely disappointed. Thin plot, zero character development and way too dark visually.The brilliance of many other alien titles, (to my taste), is the balance of light and dark, calm and frantic. Decent storylines, interesting characters and periods of light, calm and conversation giving the flashes of action and monsters far more impact whilst caring about the individuals. Add fine the acting of well cast characters in the older films this made a great recipe of interest and excitement.Sadly this version seemed only to feature a disjointed story told in the depths of darkness running from monsters all the way through. In spite of maximum action this made it quite bland, featureless and predictable. Bring back Sigourney Weaver and a talented script writer and a lighting guy!",2024-08-24
988,jashaw-58240,Aliens: Rise of Skywalker,5,"I like Fede Alvarez. I enjoyed both his Evil Dead Remake, as well as Don't Breathe, and I had very high hopes for Romulus. Unfortunately, Fede's weapons of choice, a young cast and cool, likable villain, don't really translate to the Alien universe, and the film suffers greatly for it.Right off the bat, things seem off. The movie has a very Netflix tv feel to it. There's something about the camera angles, all the characters zooms, that make it feel made for tv. When it gets going, the set pieces and atmosphere never really feel authentic to the Alien mythos, and the Romulus is poorly realized as a haunted house in space. The sets don't present the grounded realism of the first few Alien films, and they come off very video-gamey.Also, the young cast is mostly terrible, with one actor needing subtitles due to a mostly unintelligible accent. Add to that a lack of scares and very uneven pacing, and you have a really bad Alien film. Finally, the plot is just nostalgia bait. There is nothing original here, and most of the scenes that the director probably expected to hit well, had my eyes rolling. Before this film you wouldn't have ever convinced me that a scene with 50 face huggers wouldn't be terrifying, but Romulus pulls this trick twice. To add insult, the Alien doesn't show up for about an hour and a half, does basically nothing, then gets replaced by a very laughable villain in the third act.Somewhere out there, is a great follow-up to Alien and Aliens.I cannot recommend Alien Romulus.",2024-08-16

Alien Romulus is mainly a bunch of smoke and mirror distractions, i can tell the director put little capacity into filling the timeslots. The film was only gory and thats not what past alien movies were. This director tryed to contrive an alien movie using only what he sees as his horror film success. There are rumors regarding a worker on the older alien film having asked to contribute to this one. If his content were added (which it wasnt) you'd of seen retired bus driver cory anderson pushing a shopping cart containing a large piece of oak. He would stand in the dark hallways of the ship with the cart (rarly pushing it anywhere).

There is nothing new or exciting in this movie. It's like someone wanted to pay homage to the movie franchise and decided to chuck everything at it, using many past references, music, and even dialogue. There is no tension, no horror, no jumps. The story is weak to say the least, the actors are mediocre, and it all just feels like another tired outing for one the greatest monsters ever created.I really cannot understand the positive reviews for this movie.

991,Taro_movie_theater,A Disheartening Detour in the Franchise,1,"Alien: RomulusReflecting on ""Alien: Romulus"" immediately after viewing, I find myself grappling with a profound sense of disappointment.The film is marked by a lack of coherence, amateurish production values, and an over-reliance on Disney's brand, resulting in a disheartening addition to the Alien franchise.It bears resemblance to the recent Star Wars trilogy in its shortcomings.The production quality is subpar, lacking the signature Alien atmosphere and delivering poor sound design.Despite a thorough two-hour search, I could not identify any redeeming features.The film fails to build genuine tension, relying instead on a relentless series of jump scares. The performances are lackluster, the set design is uninspired, and the characters appear unnaturally pristine. The facehugger, in particular, resembles a low-end toy.The narrative is a disjointed series of convenient plot devices, lacking both clarity and depth. Issues are resolved too neatly, with no real sense of suspense or horror.The film's final moments provoke confusion, making feeling more like a zombie movie, leading to an audible reaction from me in the theater.The editing is notably unrefined, with disorienting spatial transitions. The absence of establishing shots and rapid cut sequences undermine any attempt at building suspense or immersion.The only redeeming concept is the use of alien blood (acid) in zero gravity, though its impact is diminished by its inclusion in the trailer.Cameo undermined by poor CGI, and even Benjamin Wallfisch's score, despite his usual excellence, contributes to the film's amateurish feel through its forced use of other familiar themes.It's perplexing whether Ridley Scott and James Cameron genuinely endorsed this project.Ultimately, ""Alien: Romulus"" is a disappointment that will likely fade from memory quickly. 1/10#AlienRomulus #AlienRomulus.",2024-09-28

So if you're into those kind of films where the characters act incredibly stupid, allowing for the villain to kill them with ease then this Romulus is for you. If you're looking for a film with intrigue or tension or mystery you're not going to be impressed with this installment. It's not as bad as AVP:Requiem but it's close.

The actors are young adults in their early 20s with nothing to show for and this doesnt help. The first Alien movie has so much more depth and thrilling twists that Alien Romulus never comes close to.Alien Romulus never comes close to the first Alien movie on music, acting, storyline and directing and thats why this only get 5/10 from me.

1002,celluloidjunky,"Unimaginative, dull edition to the Aliens universe",3,"I think the trailers before Alien Romulus served as some kind of premonition. Adverts that had me yawning and shaking my head. Yet another formulaic addition to Captain America, a sequel to the movie Smile, another boring FX-laden sequel to Venom, the sequel to Joker, sequel after sequel after sequel. And now Alien Romulus.Before I begin, I was never a die-hard fan of Alien. Whilst it had great special effects and set design, and was incredibly well-made, it was more than fifteen years old when I got around to watching it, and I was just a kid at the time. It was really Aliens that gripped me, a sci-fi war movie laced with horror and gratuitously over-the-top and bloated, particularly the Special Edition version, which I watched countless times as a kid. I loved the characters, the quotable one-liners (even the dodgy dubbing), the escalating situation and all the carefully constructed twists and turns - not to mention two of the greatest set-pieces in movie-making, first in the Alien hive and the second being 'that can't be that's inside the room!"" It was such a well-rounded film and a huge expansion on the original Alien. I think I appreciated the original Alien more after watching Aliens, as the two movies were perfect companions. Alien 3 had its moments. The look and feel of the film, the acting, cinematography and incredible sound design really elevated it to deserve more than a couple of stars from Empire - despite its many flaws. But that movie had a deeply troubled production which is well documented, and the comic books at the time had much better storylines that didn't kill off Newt or Hicks. As an Aliens fan, I read all the novelisations by Alan Dean Foster, the first two were well written, Alien 3, you could just tell, was written quickly because of the constant script changes. The biggest fail with Alien 3 came down to using unconvincing CGI for the creature design, and that some of the better plot elements were stripped to maximise viewings in theatres. Nevertheless the genius of David Fincher (I love it when he focuses on the chairs all colliding when Brian Glover is taken) is there for all to see. And Se7en is his masterpiece. The rest of the Aliens films, whether we're talking Alien Resurrection or Prometheus and Alien Covenant are all just poor or unwanted expansions. Resurrection, in particular, was the first real nail in the coffin for the franchise. A French director, renowned for quite quirky and strange comedies (City of Lost Children and Delicatessen) brought his really odd humour and stylistic preferences, which bore no resemblance to the films that came before. It just didn't work, and was an insult to die-hard fans.So now we have Alien Romulus. This one had a lot of excited chatter across most of social media, with most people that were party to early screenings waxing lyrical about it. Some said it was the best Aliens movie ever, or at the very least the best Aliens movie since Aliens and a return to what the franchise did best. Others said it was a mix of Alien and Aliens, and pays homage to the entire Alien Universe - that die-hard Aliens fans like me would be grinning from ear to ear watching this movie. So obviously I had to go and see it. After all, this was described as movie that, once it gets going, is utterly relentless. Sadly that is Aliens not this.So Alien Romulus. In a nutshell. It's a pretty boring movie. The characters are uninteresting (you really don't care if they all die - and there's not many of them so you know there can't be much in the way of 'kill kill death death'). The fact they're all young kids doesn't really fit either - it just feels like they're designing a movie, complete with its 15 certificate, for a new audience. It takes an age to get going when it really shouldn't. I say this because the age it takes really doesn't do much with the characters and we know what's coming so we should just cut to the chase and get there as soon as possible. Most of the fun that ensues is actually charted in the trailer, so there's not much in the way of surprises here apart from the end piece. I wouldn't describe it as a slow-burner horror, or much of an action movie (despite the trailer's promise of this and the social media frenzy that came before it). Only one short scene features a pulse rifle. I didn't think it recreated Alien 'well' either, apart from replicate its look and feel and it goes nowhere near what Aliens is in terms of adrenaline and excitement. What it does do is try to recycle as much content from across the franchise so there's really no originality. From countless Easter Eggs and recycled text, not withstanding resurrecting a very recognisable character that is an annoying distraction. Whilst I crave original movie making, certain originality just doesn't work (see my comments about Alien Resurrection), but this is pure replication designed around one or two set pieces. It's as if the writers and director thought 'wouldn't it be cool if this happened' and so they create the set pieces but forget about the sum of parts that stitch everything together. I just found this movie incredibly dull. And this comes from one of the biggest Aliens fans on the planet - someone that used to play Games Workshop's Space Hulk every day because it was so similar.On the plus side, Romulus looks and sounds great (with again some of the sound lifted from the original Alien). They downplay the CGI here and it gives it a much more authentic feel, far more like a companion piece to the original two films (and so much better than the horrible CGI from other movies). When they actually arrive, the Aliens look great (in fact they've never looked better), but we don't really see them much in this movie. Having said all this, the hive looks more like a Playstation 5 game than the original Aliens, which was far better.But the main problem with this film is that it takes too long to get going, and when it does, it's just not very interesting, a few gravity tricks aside. I also hate how the whole Alien gestation / creation period here is sped up. I remember Alien. And how long the face hugger was attached to John Hurt. How long it took to fall off of him. How he seemed fine for a while. And then the famous chest burster scene. It also took some time for the alien to grow. What probably takes some considerable time takes seemingly minutes in Romulus. It didn't take much longer in Alien 3. But it doesn't really feel right. Personally I don't think we need to see any more chest burster scenes in Aliens movies anymore (we get it - we've seen it a million times - do something different with it!), not unless it's executed in an original way. Maybe if, during the opening sequence, we saw 100 people all trapped in a large laboratory all giving birth simultaneously in slow motion, to the tune of Hound Dog by Elvis Presley (and in slow motion) it would be pretty interesting. But that's about it.This movie tried to blend parts of the whole franchise, including Prometheus, and the sum of parts made it a tiresome slog of a journey - as not everything is really sacrosanct in my mind when it comes to the Aliens universe. The space station's jeopardy is less interesting than the colony's jeopardy on Acheron. The ending, which has divided opinion, is just odd, it's an unclean ending to a deeply unoriginal film dragging its way into elements of Resurrection which were hopelessly poor then and even worse now.I hate to say it. I love Aliens. I appreciate Alien. But I'm done with the franchise now and I'm dismayed by all the positivity surrounding this movie.",2024-09-07

It's a bland and uninspired retelling that lacks the suspense and terror that made the original so iconic. A disappointing rehash that lacks the innovation and horror of the original. Boring and uninspired, it fails to add anything new to the Alien mythology.The film's lost its shine, and offers nothing new to the Alien mythos. A soulless, corporate cash grab that disrespects the legacy of the original.

The cinematography was nice, the acting was bad. Andy was a cheap copy of all the better androids played by better actors. I have to say at the end of the movie I kind of wish I had saved the money.So; If youre desperate for movie to go see, there is really nothing wrong with seeing this.

Aliens by Cameron and Romulus, which combines the first two movies and goes nowhere, it looks like a long music videoclip that has elements from all the movies with no serious story and no substance on the characters, more like an Alien salad, lol, i believe this one here is the final nail in the coffin of a legendary franchise, RIP.",2024-10-17

On the other hand, if a student had plagiarized this much on a term paper, they'd be given a failing grade. Was this generated by ChatGPT? I don't mind that this pulled ideas from the other films. Face huggers, xenomorphs and androids are all requirements of a good Alien film. However, reproducing exact situations and even using the same dialogue is totally cringeworthy.

It looked amazing - the sets and costumes were spot on and tied perfectly into the first Alien film.The practical fx were brilliant. Please more practical fx and less CGI.The acting from Cailee Spaeny and, especially, David Jonsson, was very good.The sound design was incredible and instantly brought me back into Alien universe.The claustrophobic atmosphere was great.The facehuggers, charging down the corridors, was an incredible scene.The cons:
The biggest con for this film was its reliance on nostalgia. A few little subtle nods here and there are fine. But when we have characters, eye-rollingly, shouting lines Ripley said much better, it's enough to make you want to leave.The Ian Holme CGI was awful and really distracting.Most of the characters were two-dimensional and unmemorable (plus we'd seen how most of them died in the trailer anyway).Some of the scenes, especially towards the end of the film, feel straight out of a video game.It just wasn't really that scary.There were many more cons, but I could be here all day.It tried it's best but I do question what there is left to do with this franchise.

B/C list actors, lame plot, poor writing, poor lighting, repetition, dumb dialogue, silly nods to the real Alien movie... 30 mins into this, the 3 people in my party all looked at each other and said ""well, OK, so this movie is pretty bad, so we'll just sit here and drink our beers and eat our tots and pizza, and maybe it will pick up and get better"". It didn't. Even the fanboys on here think the end was tedious. I seriously was hoping everyone in the movie would die and it would just be over so that we could finish our night doing something more fun (like staring at paint dry for example).

1009,mashdraggin-63116,Not the movie I was expecting based on other reviews,5,"Alien Romulus had excellent production values, special effects, and sets. David Jonsson did a good acting job and had an engaging personality - almost too good and human-like for an android, but the rest of the characters had flat and uninteresting personalities. This was significant as the characterizations in the other Alien movies were a strong point, even in the later sequels. Due to this it was hard to care that much about their fates, which made the tension less as well. They weren't unlikable, just very neutral. All were very young compared to the other movies so that it felt more like a YA flick than a traditional Aliens movie. This took away from the gritty feeling of the earlier films. For some reason most of them had strong British or Scottish accents, talked fast, and tended to mumble which made me wish the theatre had subtitles. Even though they were speaking in English my wife and I could not follow many of the lines. In addition the director tried but had a hard time building tension and fear - it's the only Aliens movie I've seen that I began to wonder when it was going to end. It also contained several logical inconsistencies. Having said all that, it was not an awful movie, but more of an average one. Fans of the series will want to see it of course but I'd be lying if I didn't say I was disappointed.",2024-09-06

1012,The_Swedish_Reviewer,"Too many teenagers, too few Aliens",3,"Alien Romulus is a solid addition to the franchise. It's a high-budget production filled with action and impressive effects. However, what really bothered me was that all the actors were teenagers or just slightly older. Not a single adult actor was seen, except for a not-so-great deepfake version of Ian Holm. Maybe it's just me but teens normally don't know how to operate a spacecraft. But magically these teens did, despite being low-class citizens/slaves on a ""bad"" planet, stolen from Blade Runner. And why did all teen actors speak horrible British accent? Normally I just skim the subtitles but in this movie I had to read every single sentence because everyone mumbled in a horrible unintelligible British accent.The abundance of teenagers, however, seems to have been compensated by a shortage of Aliens. We didn't see many of those except a bunch of facehuggers chasing the teens in poorly lit corridors.I was also annoyed by the attention given to 'Andy'-a damn robot! Let him do the dirty work as they did in Part 2 with ""Bishop"", instead of crying when he breaks down. A robot is a machine, like a fridge or a toaster, not a human being you care about.

And OMG the main robot guy, why does it look like he's holding in a fart or shitt his pants?! Robots don't have sad clown eyebrows.

1019,kuarinofu,"6-in-1 Alien-Prometheus franchise pack, 600% value, wow, what a deal",3,"Alien: Romulus answered a question nobody asked: ""What if a 2hr film was constructed with only references and member berries.""Short answer: You get garbage.Longer answer - the core idea that transformed a film into a 2hr nostalgia stimulation compilation was clearly a bad one.There's nothing to rate in this film, nothing to unpack. Like, I can rate a scene from this compilation, but I'll be rating a scene from 1979, or a scene from 1986, or a scene from 2012. The very short transitions between the references are few, and while some of them could have been good, the creators just didn't have time (or intention) to build upon anything. This compilation doesn't bring anything new to the table, rarely providing some unnecessary details, and connects the films in the franchise (Alien/s/3/R with Prometheus/Covenant) that should have never been related.There were no story, no characters, no acting besides David Jonsson, to whom I should apologize. He was the only redeeming quality in this compilation, but they completely wasted his character, grounding the mountain of potential behind his acting and his character.There were no twists, no tension, no atmosphere, nothing of value. The only thing you can do while watching this is try to predict which transition leads to which scene from an older film. That's it, you can even skip the scene itself because you know how it is going to resolve. But be warned - they are all borrowed from the 1979, 1986, 1992, 1997, 2012 and 2017 films. Some even have the same lines. It's insane.The worst thing, probably, was the way they shove in these scenes and references. At first it was just eye-rolling, but as the film progressed, my eyes went into my skull and stayed there. After 20 or 30 copied scenes I felt like I was getting trolled and laughed at.Overall, I'd rate Alien: Romulus absolutely disgusting/10. It was purposely made this way and it was very annoying. In star-terms, it's a 3/10, where 3 is for the production team and David Jonsson, who was a beam of light in this absolutely incoherent nostalgic nightmare.",2024-10-19

Let's hope the TV series can redeem what seems like a failing Alien franchise because for me as a lifelong fan of Alien, Aliens, Alien 3 (Directors Cut), Prometheus and Alien Covenant I'd even put Alien: Resurrection ahead of this in the canon.

1026,Campaigner,Titleens Romulus - A Special Effects Spectacle Undermined by a Flawed Crew Concept,2,"In ""Aliens Romulus,"" the filmmakers seem to have embraced the age-old formula of doomed space crews, but with a twist that misses the mark: a crew that appears to consist of teenagers, presumably to make the premise more palatable. The idea that seasoned astronauts could continually repeat the blunders of their predecessors strains credibility, especially given the rigorous selection and training required in both current and future space missions.Astronauts are expected to possess not just physical prowess, but a high level of intelligence and problem-solving ability-traits that seemed in short supply among the characters. The movie leans heavily on oversized weapons rather than on the strategic thinking that true spacefarers would bring to bear in life-or-death scenarios.While ""Aliens Romulus"" delivers some commendable special effects, creating visually gripping sequences that capture the vastness and danger of space, these achievements are overshadowed by subpar acting and a storyline riddled with inconsistencies and goofs. The plot ventures into familiar territory without bringing anything fresh to the table, serving up a series of predictable and avoidable missteps by the crew that leave the audience questioning their qualifications.Overall, while ""Aliens Romulus"" promised the thrill of a space adventure, it falters significantly. The visual successes are undermined by a narrative and character development that fail to engage or convince, leaving viewers yearning for a more intelligent and coherent exploration of extraterrestrial challenges.",2024-10-24

Firstly after watching this and coming from an alien fan, this movie was a mixed bag of good and bad.Now coming from the director who brought you the remake of Evil Dead, which was excellent and Don't Breathe, which was also very good, I had very high hopes for this but alas it didn't live up to the hype.In this mixed box of tricks you get a mixture of characters you don't care about and half the time come across as spoilt brats. Characters that you do t care about, at least with the original you cared about the characters.Secondly the first time you see the face huggers, there was no tension at all, even with the chest burst scene, it came across as so, so.Let's talk about the tension for awhile, oh that's right there wasn't any, unfortunately.After finishing the movie I came away with, it was okay, worth a watch but not a second time. The director is still good but you can tell here he didn't know what he wanted from a movie from this franchise.Did He want the slow build up tension of Alien or did he want the frantic pace of Aliens, I can see he tried for both but in the end came away with a mixed bag of neither, in reality he came away with a mess.Now we need to quickly talk about the marketing hype of this movie and others, I wish it would stop. Most reviews on here giving this movie 8, 9's and 10 ratings are either falling for the hype or have something to do with this movie.Overall a mess of a film that just comes across as average after all the hype.If you asked me which Alien film to watch I would tell people to go back and watch the original, after all you can't beat it.",2024-10-09

1033,durham100,Very Meh...,5,"I saw this at the cinema today and I wished I'd waited for it to come on TV. I'm a big fan of the original and this pales greatly in comparison. A lot of the characters were unlikeable and I didn't really warm to any of them so that I was rooting for their safety and survival.This is a big movie and it says something when the most well known cast member is no longer with us. The rest all have a very short CV and you can tell. Nobody is bad, just there isn't anyone with a significant screen presence and the overall result is that despite the brilliant creatures, it all feels a little unexciting. There are one or two decent passages but I kind of left the theatre thinking, why did they bother? You just expect more from something Ridley Scott is involved in.",2024-08-16

1036,kuner-59029,Dumbed down Disney product without ambition,4,"Memberberries galore.After Ridley Scott's cerebral Prometheus, the studio got cold feet and wanted more classic monster horror. Alien: Covenant was a first step down, but still had some brilliant ideas, mainly involving the android David.But for the lunkheads at Disney, even that was too cerebral, and they did the only thing they could do:Take out everything that was interesting or intelligent and add memberberries.Granted, it could have been worse. The production design is surprisingly good, and Fede Alvarez is a decent if somewhat limited director. But conceptually, the film is a mess.For one, most of the actors speak in such a heavy British accent that it borders on parody. ""Deys sumtin in da woha"" (""There's something in the water""). It's ridiculous.Disney wanted to return Alien to the original, but forgot that part of the original's charm was that the characters didn't act like slasher movie victims. They were professionals, intelligent and capable, and still fell victim to the Alien.In Romulus, they act like teenagers, shoving each other around (while one of them has a facehugger on them), yelling at the android, and constantly swearing.The main character's backstory is the usual anti-capitalist propaganda we've come to expect from Disney, with Weyland-Yutani exploiting her planet as slave labor. Yes, the anti-corporate overtones were in the original films, but they're far less subtle and intelligent here.Nuance? That's banned at the house of mouse. Can't make a gazillion dollars at the box office, unless you target the IQ <70 crowd.The movie blatantly steals ideas from precious alien movies. Including the big idea from Alien: Resurrection.A character from Alien 1 shows up. You can probably imagine who. The CGI is as atrocious as you'd expect.The film's does excep when it comes to action and horror. Those scenes were well shot, intense, properly disgusting. The exterior space scenes looked great, too.Still, I would rather rewatch the last two Ridley Scott films than this paint by numbers effort.",2024-08-20

I want to say unrealistic but then it is only fiction - you get my meaning.Also, this seemed to be just an elaborate remake of the original Alien movie full of clichés referable to the original. As soon as I saw the freon-bird toy and helmut - like things at the beginning of the movie, I knew it was going to be a disappointment.Instead of expanding the franchise by maybe having the aliens appear on Earth, they just redid the original.The hollywood adage - ""More of the same but different"" is appropriate here.",2024-08-27
1038,khaktus,Wannabe homage becomes unashamed uninventive rip off,4,"How many times can you try to kill off the franchise with miserable sequels, prequels and now in-quels? Well, this is a perfect organism, a survivor!I admit I am a huge fan of Aliens and Alien (in this order) and the franchise itself - even with so many attempts to destroy it, as Ripley (and her subsequent generic stand-ins) tried to destroy the Xenormorph. I get quite perplexed by some (paid?) reviews saying ""fans will love it"". Who? Fans of what? There's no cost in such statements, just the sheer calculation: it might convince a few more people to come to see it and pay for the ticket. Money are never refunded after the movie screening, right? The only aim is to make yet another gullible spectator eat the bite and pay.Here's the recipe:
One cup of jump scares. (""Because we are making a horror movie, like the pros, yeah!"")
Half cup of forgettable teenage cannon fodder (Who else goes to the cinema? For what else than the generic genre audiovisual products?).Quarter cup of romance. (Seriously, this, in an Alien movie?).Five gallons of ""exploding, gore, tentacles, slime, smoke"". (Like in any new Marvel/DC clone)
Far too many pinches of ""homage"" winks.Since long time Hollywood feels like not making real movies anymore - just the generic products prepared by the oversized marketing departments, to pay off reliably. Munch the pop-corn, turn off the brain, get entertained by blinked CGI. No creative ideas, no original story, no characters (daresay their development!), no empathy, no meaning or message, no memorable soundtrack easily associated with that one movie (just the background noise for the scenes, in the most cliche sense: ""the action"" ""the suspense"" ""the magnificence"").This is indeed a teenage horror movie in space. Since they do not know any other way to keep 'em thrilled, they have to repeat one jump scare after another. ""Because that is fun."" Boo! - haha!, repeat, boo! - haha!, repeat. Same dumb joke over and over again. Next popcorn. Next popcorn. Next popcorn. As if this - more of the same old trick - was the point of a horror or any other type of movie. While some might point out that this element was also present in the Alien(s) classics - yeah, it was present there, but not the point of it all. The suspense of unknown and unseen, the slow revelation of the various aspect of a totally alien life-form, the imperfect characters brought into impossible situations, the desperation, the fake victories, the unfathomable greed and malice.The Alien characters were middle-aged blue-collar workers f..d by the corporation, though mentally slightly unstable, a toxic cocktail even without the Xenomorph (who serves more as a trigger for their deficiencies to play out). The Aliens had the bad-ass soldiers (iconic ones, copied ever since) versus civilians tension. Experienced/inexperienced, macchiavelists/dummies, tough/sensitive, bold/cautious, weary/vital dynamics resplendent - even for a sci-fi action movie. What does Romulus ""sacrifice"" at the altar of horrors - some unconvincing, dumb, tasteless teenagers?I do wonder what new thing have I seen in this ""new installment in the franchise"" (saying this with reluctance). Nothing. Except the ""new monster"" that looks like from a completely different movie. Even Scott's Prometheus and Covenant have brought in some creatures that feel alien to the original Giger's Alien design, or its further free adaptation in Aliens. A frenzy of grey slimy worms and tentacles, that are more disgusting than scary or otherworldly. Not to mention Scott's need to explain certain aspects of Xenomorph cosmology/biology in a way that no one asked him to, that few fans liked really, that denies the aesthetics of the original Aliens, that denies all the years of fan fictions, flattens all those free running fantasies into contemporary hype ""genetic engineering, AI"". And he surely loves those - as he proved even in late Raised by Wolves. An so under his production, yet another ugly (and not in a good way) creature needs to see the perpetual darkness of the space. A one-thousand-th copy of some annoyingly familiar grey-tentacled-toothed-slimy-monster from any generic comic/sci-fi/horror movie after year 2000. As if the perverse but stylish imagination died out in Hollywood after H. R. Giger?I can't even figure out what was the business with the constant homage. One of the strongest (but often overlooked) features of the first two Alien(s) movies was what I call ""the immersive experience"". You go on a mission with a crew, you walk with them step by step, from the tension in the first encounter of the group-to-form, through the first-hand taste of the shaky descend to the surface, and then walking the haunted castle that feels eerily familiar though spookily damaged - and that contrast throws you off balance. But throughout the experience you feel like one member of the group, living the horrorful adventure with them. That particular screenwriting skill seems vanished. Why do I need to be constantly winked at in Romulus, with those ""homage"" inserts, and thus taken out of the possible immersive experience? One or two such winks might be pardonable, but when you build the whole movie of the lines and scenes of some other movies - it stops being an ""homage"" and it becomes a plagiate. So unashamed that it leaves you speechless, in cringe - that someone actually dared to do this, and seriously.As many have pointed out, this movie has become a 1:1 warning signal (that some misunderstood as SOS) to the corporate greed, that eventually destroys anything good. Rendering the new Alien installment as a predictable teenage horror movie hybridized with any-contemporary-blockbuster product, is quite an insult to the franchise. One possible aspect of this are the generic positive reviews, that seem most probably paid for (this is the ear of copywriters and even text generated by AI), or perhaps written by folks who missed the whole ""bold innovative cinema"" eras that ended silently after 2000s and were breast-fed only on the generic corporate products and think that this is the masterly art. I am particularly amused by the fake reviews that look like cowing to the fans' dislike of the bad sequels and bad prequels in the Alien franchise, bowing to the seemingly unsurpassable first iconic movies, but all in a well calculated intention - to make you feel ""on the same wavelength"", to get you curious - and ultimately pay. That is your only purpose. If Weyland-Yutani did a marketing campaign for a new Alien movie, it would look something like this. Alas, it has become a well established practice.I liked the initial world-building attempt, even if the ""corporate tyranny"" is sketched in a tasteless caricature that could be anything - Andor or 1984 - especially that old corpulent lady in the booth, so cliche, almost a cheep ""kids playing at ..."" parody. Like the rest of the movie. I liked the initial slower pace - I don't need my movies to be packed with senseless action from the start till the end. One of the mature feats of the first Alien(s) movies )and many sci-fi classics) is that they are quite slow, they take their time to immerse you in the story, the dynamics between characters, the claustrophobic limits of the space and time they draw. I liked the human-android theme that they tried to play out, but remained at the doorstep, most of the time. I am not sure if I liked the 1970s technology - yet another futile homage to the first movies, barely switching any of the right bodily buttons.",2024-08-19

1040,jonnsz,Aliens by numbers - poor imitation,5,"Watching this film back-to-back with Aliens really highlighted its 'Netflix' feel in terms of film quality and visual representation. The attempt to recreate an '80s slasher vibe with a teen cast didn't land for me-there wasn't anything particularly memorable about it.There was never a real sense of danger or genuine fear. While there were a couple of gross-out moments, the effects looked subpar and failed to make much impact. The main Alien design was laughably bad.A couple of days have passed now, and after having more time to absorb it, I can honestly say that the more I reflect on it, the more I'm surprised by how much it dropped the ball. It was fine for a one-time watch, but I wouldn't revisit it. The overall look felt cheap, especially in an era where it seems like filmmakers have forgotten how to create a truly good-looking movie. I doubt this will be a memorable addition, akin to AvP2.If this is the future direction of the Alien franchise, then the brand might already be long dead and buried.If you thought this was a 10, I'd highly recommend exploring the earlier Alien films-there's so much more depth and quality in the back catalog that's worth experiencing....have you seen AVP1, I think you will like it.",2024-10-18

1047,trigaming,Progressively worse,4,"I was very careful not to include any spoilers in my review because there aren't any!When I first started watching this movie, I kept an open mind and had no intention of writing any sort of review. If you look at the reviews written by those who rated this movie as a 5 or less, they were spot on and correctly and pointed out just about everything wrong with this movie.It actually starts off pretty good with a good story line, and I started to rate it as a 7 and go up or down from there. I was actually interested in what was happening and was enjoying the new synthetic Andy. The ground vehicles were silly, you just don't have large heavy vehicles moving around in such close proximity to civilian traffic like that. Still, it looked like we were off to a good start, and it was holding my interest for the time being.However, as the movie progressed my opinion kept getting lower and lower. First a 7, then it dropped to 6, then 5, then finally a 4. As it turned out, this movie has NOTHING, and I mean NOTHING original in it except one small scene. That being the Zero G combat scene, which had a clever idea by our hero and fit the scene perfectly and had some nice visual effects. The rest of the movie has the writers taking the best scenes of all the other movies, especially Alien and Aliens, and just copying those scenes and placing them randomly throughout this movie. When I say copying, that was exactly what they did, and it felt like Déjà vu. As you watch the movie, you are easily able to guess not only what was going to happen next, but you also felt the urge to shout which movie the scene was stolen from. This left little to no surprises for the viewer and for me, well I just about hit the fast forward button in places as I did not care to see what was happening.Nothing was new.Nothing was creative.Nothing inspiring.Nothing of note.As I watched, I couldn't care less about the characters, and all I thought about was which scenes were going to be stolen next from each of the other movies. The dialog was lacking, the action of the characters was downright stupid and rather predictable - mostly predictable because they were copying exactly what happened before, and the acting was bland and flat.I want to say that the visual effects were great, and they would have been great if they hadn't all been done before in the other movies. This smelled like a fan written movie, tasted like a fan written movie, and stank like a fan written movie. They did have all the correct sound effects, probably one of the simplest things to do.It should be noted that I am a huge fan of the Alien franchise, and books for that matter, and VERY critical of sequels for any movie. I tend to nitpick the little things, but these issues will stare you right in the face. The trend, in the later Alien movies, has been slowly going downhill and this one flatlined for me.Watch it if you want but do not expect anything new.",2024-11-14

The whole run-time can be summed up as ""Member this? Member that? We'll show you the exact same things again but worse and without context."" I didn't have any expectations going in and was still let down. I liked Alvarez's Evil Dead, but since then he only went downhill. If you're an Alien movies' fan don't bother, unless you already made your peace with franchise ending a long time ago, treat all the ""new stuff"" as post mortem convulsions, and cinically additionally enjoy an enormous dose of 'cringe'.

They're all young, but that's not the worst part-beyond the fact that they have nothing to do with the Alien franchise. The story jumps from one bad sequence to another, with no connection between them. The intro is boring as hell. The story around the black android is a non-starter (and for that matter, it wouldn't matter if the protagonist was white). The rest of the actions are meaningless, poorly designed, and lack tension and real drama. I mean real personal drama, not just general story arcs. The movie doesn't even try to build characters; they're all thrown into a meat grinder that is shallow and poorly designed.

A lot of recent sci-fi movies and sitcoms include holograms of younger selves of actors who made their prequel originals fame and classic.

1053,supremeskill,Mix of unnecessities,3,"The movie starts rather promisingly, portraing the protagonists, including an android dude, right off the bat, just like other Alien movies (that I've seen), but then some cliches regarding the franchise itself start to creep in. All is yet not too bad on the space station in the scenes you have already seen in the final trailer, the friction is there, the situations are pretty thrilling, but the further the movie advances, the more unnecessary things are loaned from the previous entries, while action gets a tad confusing without much impact. With impact I partly mean the woman protagonist's lack of any true heroism, kind of the opposite to Ripley in the original. Perhaps Ripley was not a hero, but at least he was a character with undeniable strength in her, which was the reason for her survival, since she kind of like beat the alien(s).Perhaps you think now, that the visuals are the reason to see this particular sequel, but alas, even if they are done with real props, they are a bit messed up with after effects. To me it seems there is often unneeded background blur blocking clear vision, and it felt on a big screen that even some strange filters were used, which make the movie feel mostly digital, just like any movie full of computer generated effects. Visuals may impress you, but likely only half of the time.Music is kind of strange in this one, since more than once for a moment I felt like watching a Star Wars movie and another time some James Cameron thingy with orchestral instruments, lifting or pronouncing the spirit in the scene. I don't think these fit the movie at all, and I'm not saying I don't like Cameron's work (Titanic is a marvellous movie), even if I'm not a big fan of movie Aliens, but rather that there is a good reason why the original Alien is so silent and there is a reason for not using certain kind of music in horror movies. These strange choices of music add to the result of mixing things from the past with different ideas, all together resulting in a mishmash, the whole experience being a true mixed bag, leaning overall to the negative side.Even if there is some good acting involved (kudos to Isabela Merced and David Jonsson) and a neat idea with the androids, which was the only truly intriguing part of the experience, it waters down when in the end there is simply too much nastiness and undeveloped ideas with action that feel like a filler to get the whole thing done. My overall score is 1,5/5 stars (so 3 stars on a scale of 10), which I assure will feel too harsh when you are at the beginning of the trip, but likely you will feel more or less let down once you realize this is not a movie that truly expands on the universe.",2024-08-15

The story I liked because they incoporated the storyline from 'Alien' and the synthetic (Ian Holm). One thing I had a hard time with was trying to understand what the actors were saying. They had very heavy accents and with the music mixed with it I was lost. So, there are portions of the film I really had no idea what was being said. The biggest complaint, the actors, I am tired of seeing a big film like 'Alien - Romulus' trying to keep up with the originals and offer actors who are only in their 20's. It was NOT believable at all. I kept waiting for a character to be in their 30's, 40's, or even older. Each part of this franchise has believable characters. These were NOT! Look, I get what the director was trying, but failed on what could have been a GREAT FILM! Millennials in space is fine if you're going to put some adults up there with them.

The engineers weren't related to the black goo, that comes from an alien that they found so how does it have the appearance of an engineer?And the main characters plot armor is basically impenetrable.as my sister said as we left the theatre, ""a movie has to be more than the sum of its parts"" and that's all this was, a sum of parts that didn't gel together too well. Not one character was likable and the CGI for Ian holm was absolutely shockingly bad. Just stop de-aging people, it's very obviously nit there yet technology wise so why even try?",2024-08-21

Only Tyler's beloved was killed, and after 30 seconds he forgot about it, playing the role without any emotions. Bravo!It's a mystery to me, why do people give high marks? Have we completely forgotten how to appreciate a good movie? There's a very weak acting, there's a very very weak script. I would give this film a score of 2, but I can't, because the music and cinematography are good. But everything else is very bad. Why are you guys giving high marks? What is the reason?

1061,VBeretta,"The ""Best of"" the Alien franchise plus Alien Isolation - but little else",5,"The best way to review this movie is to cut to the chase and mention the two BIG PROBLEMS that drag it down.First: there are no characters. The two original movies in the franchise presented their characters so masterfully that you needed just a glance to become acquainted with them. The breakfast scene in the first Alien tells you everything you need to know about the crew of the Nostromo. In Aliens, Vasquez only needs to show up on camera to be, you know, Vasquez. Even in Alien 3 there is an effort to give tridimensionality to the characters (something pulled off better in the longer cut).Here? I just came out of the theatre, and I can tell you that the main character is named Rain, that there is someone who is an ass towards synthetics, and that another character is a bald female Asian. Some effort is put into giving depth to the unavoidable android, but - beside the astounding fact that an android more advanced than Ash in the original Alien should, for some unexplained reason, be emotionally stunted - the end result is messy and never convincing.Second: to call this movie ""derivative"" doesn't even cover it. It is a shot-by-shot collection of all the best moments and images from the other movies (even the fourth one, go figure). Plus that videogame masterpiece, Alien: Isolation. Actually, I think that this movie robs more from Alien: Isolation than any actual Alien movie. When you see a scene and you think, ""Boy, I remember this level in the game! It took me a whole afternoon to beat it!"" you just wonder where creativity went in 2024.This is a movie that made me, literally while watching it, to play a game of ""How they will redo this famous scene?"" The male character teaching the female character how to use a pulse rifle? Check. The female character entering danger zone with her pulse rifle ready, her hair slowly moving in the wind? Check. During a countdown? Check. A hole caused by acid blood that goes down for several levels? Check. A Alien three inches from the main character's face pressed against a wall? Check. That memorable sequence from Alien Isolation in the Alien lair? Check. WHOLE SETS ROBBED FROM ALIEN: ISOLATION? Check. Final message from the only survivor? Check. The most disgusting idea from AvP2? Check... And I'm not even spoiling the big ones.In all fairness, not all sequences rob from better movies in the Alien franchise. Some sequences rob from better movies ranging from Blade Runner to Event Horizon. I can't literally name a single interesting scene in Romulus without remembering where I saw it first - with the rest being uninteresting. I mean... I'm writing this after just seeing the movie, and I can't remember a single line.The plot... what plot? The only way to be surprised by ""Romulus"" is not to have seen a single other Alien movie. Otherwise, you can predict what will happen to the minute (banal jumpscares excluded... BTW, one of such jumpscares is robbed from Alien: Isolation - just sayin').This is a movie where you have to accept that, when on a Weyland-Yutani space station devoted to studying the Xenomorphs things go south, WY hasn't an emergency beacon so that such a costly facility can be tracked and recovered (not even when such a station is RIGHT ABOVE A WY off-world installation). Where people swim in zero-G, around deadly things, like if they are in water. Where if you raise the temperature of a room to average bodly temperature thermal sensors won't see you - without care for clothing, for how the average temperature varies from person to person, or even for how different body parts in the individual have different temperatures. Where in zero-G the acid blood of a Alien destroyed by a pulse rifle won't explode in any directions anyway, consuming the metal between a habitat and deep space. And the list goes on.So, why five stars? Because all the ingredients were there. The sets are great (mostly because they robbed from good sets); the creature effects are great; the cinematography is great (the music, however, isn't)...At the end, Romulus is a movie who seems to be drenched in fear. Not scares for us, but the fear to... go outside the comfort zone of the ""already done"" the ""exact way it was done"". I didn't like the original AvP by Paul W. S. Anderson, but at least he tried - and the homages were clever homages. There is a single addition to the Alien lore here: how a small chestbruster can grow into a full Alien. It is nice, but that's all. Keep it dear.(And, after all I saw, I will not soon stop wondering... why they didn't just do ""Alien: Isolation - The Movie"" in the first place?)",2024-08-14

While for the young audience, except for the last half hour, there is absolutely zero action and the story is not interesting, for people in their fifties who have enjoyed first two movies in the cinema, it is not interesting to watch a bunch of poorly written, immature and over-smart teenagers. It should be noted that, apart from the fact that the viewer doesn't have a single reason to cheer for the people in the film or to wish that any of the characters survive. Except for the visual effects Alien: Romulus has nothing at all and can't be recommended to any fan of the series. At most, someone who hasn't seen any of the Alien movie and doesn't want to spend a lot of time watching the other ones to understand all the connections that are summarized here in two hours. The revival of the series as in the case of Predator and his Prey is not happening here. Two stars for the action-packed last thirty minutes.

This film nails the atmospherics of the first two Alien films. If you're looking for the nostalgia of the two best films in the franchise, you'll appreciate the throwbacks here. The Aliens themselves are presented well. No heavy CGI throughout the film as is the case more often then not theses days, but a good blend of special effects and use of animatronics / props.The Bad:
The script is weak to the point where characters become annoying in their delivery. There are a ridiculous number of reused lines from the first two films. I'm not sure why they thought this was a good thing to include, but it's just cringe worthy and takes you right out of being immersed.The cast is the epitomy of Gen Z. If you know, you know. I didn't care about what happened to any of them as the film progressed. I actually looked forward to the Aliens getting hold of them!Cameos and Easter eggs a-plenty in this film. Do film makers these days think this is what we want? Nostalgia bait and cameo candy? We just want solid stories told by solid professionals. We don't need 'a message' and we don't need 'nostagila!' Tell a great story and we'll be happy. Sadly, around an hour and a half in, the story here trails off into absurdity and doesn't let up. The ending left me confused and deflated! What a waste of what could have been a good film.Alien fans will be devided. The attention to detail, atmospherics and echoes back to the franchise, will absolutely be enough for most.

Bringing back Rook was odd given that the actor died like 4 years ago. And you could tell the CGI was on its last leg. I was honestly hoping for more give the trailer.

The appreciation of the set design though begins to wear off as you enter nearly a hour into the movie where scenes begin to become repetitive.The movies real main setback is the repetitive nature as the movie length seems to feel like rather than cutting scenes to reduce the time they included everything to pad the time.The beginning crew was not developed enough at all, felt really disconnected the entire time. They should have scrapped the end scenes for raw character development. The most insane decision early on in the movie immediately comes to mind, as generally It doesn't follow how human beings psychologically work.This movie director has a lot of talent and seems to have a knack for space horror, if Fede Álvarez replaces the third act and develops the characters more in this movie, It would get a 9/10 from me.",2024-08-22

Without spoiling anything, you will find countless references to the Alien franchise here, but none clever or subtle, every single one was laughable and this could easily be viewed as spoof film if it was marketed a such. I'm sure someone on YouTube could cut a trailer to suit. There's not one bit of originality here. Uninteresting, young characters that will only appeal to a tweens, not the mature audience of the original movies. Even Resurrection has better moments than anything in this movie. There was one moment that I thought was a slightly original idea, but what followed was one of the biggest jokes of the movie. Ridley Scott is forced to endorse this movie because it's a Scott Free movie. He can't possible think this is actually any good. He's got to say it's good, but I can't accept he truly believes that. Remember the 40th anniversary shorts? They are all better that this and the last decent work done for this franchise. Watching this movie just made me think, ""perhaps there's nothing left to tell in this franchise"", there's no new ideas to be found anymore it seems, certainly not in this movie anyway, everything here is a copy of what's come before, a parody that we don't need.

It's worse, way worse than the already over used horror trope of main character(s) stumbling upon bad situations one after another. The movie is also filled with terrible tropes like friendly jumpscare, forced split teams etc.For a movie rated R, it's shockingly shy about showing blood and gore. The classic gore scene associated with the Alien franchise (yes, that one) is shown in such a tame manner and for such a short time on screen that you question whether this movie is truly rated R. All other ""gore"" scenes are PG13 compatible.Acting wise, nothing remarkable. The best and most believeable emotions from all actors are when they see the monster(s). When there is no monster nearby, everyone just acts like a lukewarm glass of water around each other. The best acting throughout the movie ironically comes from a robot character. That should tell you a lot about all these nameless B listers' acting ability.Overall below average as a horror movie and below average in the Alien franchise.

Wait for the VHS instead.,5,"While I can appreciate the effort of the director and writers put in to establish the correct tone for this picture, ultimately it is less ""Alien"" and more ""Friday the 13th"".One of the issues I had (ignoring that just anyone in this picture can grab a ship and take off into orbit) was with the complete unlikability of the characters. At no point was there an effort to make a bond between them and the audience, and as each one faced their demise, I had yet to decide who I was siding for, the crew member or the alien.It wasn't until the android character ""Andy"" was given some development, that I started to appreciate the charm that actor David Jonsson was able to bring to the role. Make no mistake, the only interesting character in this haunted house flic is Andy the android, except for one major error; when for zero reason the android utters one of Sigourney Weaver's best lines. It's jarring, it's stupid, and incorrect for the context.Unfortunately that wasn't the only flaw. The director made the same mistake that we saw in ""Alien Resurrection"", the birth of a non-Geiger human form Alien. Without the insectoid grace and originality of the original Geiger, the humaniform creature comes off as a ""slenderman"" homage jammed into the wrong franchise. The creature is so laughable, it may have been wise to have ended the picture just before this non-climatic final climax. This was made worse when the ship decided, apparently on it's own to dramatically change course and destroy itself. No explanation is given for this unbelievable plot point, so I would assume a major scene had to be cut out and this was what remained. I didn't care what happened at this point. Neither did the director apparently, because it is a completely unoriginal, almost shot for shot recreation of Alien's climatic ending.

The lead, Rayne is no Ripley and the android completely lacks the charisma of both Bishop and the original android and the rest of the characters are even more uninteresting.So not only are the character boring and bland but apparently the whole alien life cycle has been simplified and are more like a zombie transmission than the complex, horrific lifecycle that it was in the original movies.No, this movie tries hard to replicate the original movies but fails miserably.

There are parts of the space station set which look like they were pulled out of the original 1970s set--and this sort of nostalgia, it's just not good. Add in the ghastly Prometheus elements (without saying spoilers) and none of it was really pleasant.I predicted every single death and event that happened in the movie with 100% accuracy, in other words it was entirely predictable. A boring plot, relatively unlikable characters and face huggers they didn't behave normally. (I'll say that much without spoiling)Also there needs to be a massive warning label on this movie for anyone prone to migraines or seizures. There are so many OBSCENE high pitched moments in the film that it was so fkn unlikeable that I had to plug my ears. I'm prone to migraines but the people I went with are NOT. We ALL left with our skills pounding to the point of dizziness. Imagine that generic as hell high pitched basic wailing sfx. Now imagine that add going on for ten seconds to a minute at a time. Between the bass and the screeching high pitched ""oh a spooky scene is coming"" noise, I wanted to walk out from the pain in my skull.Final words: it wasn't scary. It wasn't even remotely frightening. It was gory which was the same flaw of all of the TERRIBLE Prometheus films. The original quadrilogy sold the terror by having numerous moments of SILENCE.

The original 4 films never relied on dramatic and terrible horror screams and wails to make it *seem* scary.I don't know what they were thinking when they made this and what's more is the ludicrous 97% positive rating that the ""critics"" gave it. Clearly these ""professionals"" suck at their jobs because this film is a 5/10 best.",2024-08-17
1086,register-60055,Disappointing,3,"Terrible.The first half was a Scooby Doo movie with a childish robot instead of a great dane. The usual cast; a strong, sympathetic male character, an angry bully, a ""weak"" female (and a strong one per Alien canon) and an Asian pilot.Most of the cast had a British accent, which means it's hard to understand most of the dialogue. I couldn't figure out WHAT the ""mission"" was. (Was there one?)The second half was ""how much of every previous Alien movie can we cram into this one?""There are technical errors and in consistencies, as in every sci-fi movie, but these impact the course of the story (not specified to prevent spoilers).Once again, an attempt to replicate the first two, virtually perfect films disappointed epically.",2024-08-28
1087,glvandermeer,A childish Disappointment,4,"Initially I had great hopes for what seemed like a stand alone New Alien film, and the early trailers looked good, but I was disappointed within the first 10 minutes to see the bad dialog and poor storyline just spiral into what was a waste of time, the characters were all too young to be taking on the actions of knowledgeable characters within this story, and you don't spend any time with any of them long enough to either care or understand who they are, this easily could just be the latest installation of the film franchise ""Scream"" set in space, the dialog is poorly written and the talentless cast delivers it with with equal ineptness, if there is a bright side it's the art direction and the practical EFX, but the blatant copied shots and thematic scenes stollen from the original '79 film, do nothing to add to the film, rather they actually make you yearn for a rewatch. After 10 minutes of this film I lost patience with the poor acting, the terrible dialog and the infantile story line, don't waste your time, watch the original again instead.",2024-08-25

Unlike the other alien movies in the franchise this one firstly failed on the characters. All unrelatable and you don't care about what happens to them at all! From constant stupidity which lands them where they are to dry copied dialogue from other movies. It fails to deliver. The action sequences were good at some points but very predictable! It started to feel lengthy and at some points you just wanted the movie to end! Nothing will compare to the first 4 alien movies which were done so well. Sorry Ridley Scott, I think you knew this was going to be a f up!",2024-08-16

The lead actress was Rei-lite, another Mary Sue who apparently made weird choices that still allowed her to live. Then to top it off, she sticks a robot into cryo-stasis. What the..?The movie was doomed when they revealed it would be a teenage-oriented cast, like Twilight or Hunger Games, where they would all be way too clever to get killed.But eventually they did because they couldn't bring everyone back for a sequel. It seemed like the director was trying to rip off the first Alien as much as possible. Even the little robot 'cameo' was horribly done, the worse CGI ever. They might as well have used a hand puppet, it would have looked more realistic.Most of the movie was really dark, but instead of giving atmosphere, it just made the scenes more confusing. Like the whole elevator shaft scene made no sense. And where did all these Xenomorphs suddenly come from in like less than 10 minutes when everyone on the ship was already 'dead'?The weird monster at the end also made no sense, how did the injection not affect the girl?! Like it did the rat?! Again, made no sense.Overall a hot mess of a disappointment. Avoid this one at all costs.",2024-08-30

It had a few decent ideas, but didn't give itself the time to explore them.While the original trilogy and Prometheus films seemed massive in scale even when their settings were claustrophobic, exploring big themes and expanding the series' mythology, this felt like it was quickly thrown together to make a quick buck.

What should have happened and would have made a far better movie was all ship explorers get infected by face huggers on spaceship then get the android to move them all to the mining planet then the face huggers would start infecting people, lots more exploding chests, more blood and gore and more aliens running amok on the planet , instead of this overhyped probably high budget b movie.",2024-08-18
1092,TheVictoriousV,"'Member ""game over, man""?",4,"Alien: Romulus was one of the most anticipated films of the summer and, from what I could glean when I read the reviews, one of the most disappointing. Cinephiles were ready for Ridley Scott to cook with as much sauce as he did when he made Prometheus and Covenant (although the directing duties went to Fede Álvarez for this one) but the early reactions suggested more of a ""Member Berry"" type movie:Metaplex's Brendan Hodges argued that it's the first Alien movie to not be ""about"" anything other than the fact that it's an Alien film. In similar terms, David Ehrlich wrote that it's ""about nothing more than the corporate grotesqueries of its own existence"". Not the best sign, to say the least.I even saw people compare it unfavorably to 1997's baffling Alien: Resurrection (citing superior setpieces). I've seen haters AND lovers compare it to Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. Having seen it, I can tell you that it resembles Rogue One in one particular and quite disgusting respect. I might be giving too much away if I say that another movie that comes to mind is 2023's execrable The Flash but f-ck it.However, I can't say I was all too disappointed per se. The only things I had high hopes for were the practical effects and costumes, which are all first-rate -- even more impressive than the Predator suit in 2022's Prey.The movie also delivers in terms of goo, blood, and, occasionally, artful camera work (although none of it is ever as potent as in the previous films; neither the gore nor the cinematography). Unfortunately, it is very much the Alien series' equivalent of, well, all these other movies that try to win favor by reminding you which franchise they're in and also how much you love said franchise.The characters and story aren't worth mentioning. That's not why you're here. Even if it is, the movie doesn't think that that's why you're here. The characters exist to spout references and die by extraterrestrial dick-mouth. The actors fail to live up to the cast of any singular previous entry in the series. Sometimes the acting is good, yes, but where are the ""presences""? You know, like the presence of Weaver, Fassbender, Henriksen, Paxton, Hurt, or Holm? Note that I mean ACTUAL presence.The Alien franchise is, at least in part, defined by its distinct characters and character actors. We don't get that here. We get superbly constructed sets and the odd inventive action scene, but other than that, we get very little besides the dreadful realization that nobody gets to rest in peace in modern Hollywood -- neither the characters we no longer need to see nor the actors who once played them. Of all franchises to devolve into incessant key-jangling to get a Pavlovian response out of fanboys, it's a shame it had to happen to Alien, but I suppose it was inevitable. Remember who now owns the company that owns the Alien IP?I had problems with the previous two films (especially in how Covenant partly felt like a first-movie rehash, which I would've been okay with if that's where the franchise ended, in a ""full circle"" sort of way, but here we are). That said, a proper conclusion to the so-called ""David Trilogy"" would doubtless have been more interesting than what we got here. (Another comparison I see in a lot of reviews is that Romulus is to the ""David"" movies as The Rise of Skywalker is to The Last Jedi.) The origin story of the xenomorphs was never something I really ""wanted"" to see, but there was indeed more to those films -- those explorations -- than Romulus.At least most viewers seem to agree that it's better than Alien vs. Predator: Requiem so it has that going for it. Not bad for a human. (See? I can do it too.)",2024-08-17
1093,arcadia-56707,Derivative trash,4,"Low score is partly because I was so hyped for this movie and it's supposed return to the real storyline and movie making magic from aliens 1 and 2. To say this movie is derivative is an understatement of the year. When I say EVERY SCENE is a rip off I mean EVERY scene. Not only are the scenes taken straight from other movies, every sound effect, every camera angle, every production value and even every line is from the other movies. They even say ""get away from her you b**"" 🙄 i mean wow....
The story also blends all the nonsense from Prometheus about how it's a virus thingy that can mutate your cells.... Double eye roll. The whole thing plus out in real time of a countdown (never had that before) of 47 mins. And in the next 17 mins the alien hatches and is fully grown... oh and apparently you can create facehuggers by reverse engineering the zenomorph DNA... ummmm ok.It was entertaining enough but it's such a derivative rip off of the other movies it's shocking.

Especially in the beginning set pieces look great and it feels like Alien or Aliens world.Acting is ok at best. To me there's nobody in this movie that can carry it like Sigorney did with Alien or in Aliens. Actor who played Andy was good.Then there's something that took me out of the movie completely and it was fan service that didn't need to be there. Also it looked bad. Like ps3 era video game bad.

Some of the visual eggs were well crafted such as the alien Isolation door mechanisms and the save station made it visually pleasing in places, and the Xeno's were still better looking than many we have seen historically, however lacked the feeling of fear and dread I have come to associate in prior films. They just don't seem that scary, with little suspense and a noticeable lack of that ""stalker-hunter"" mechanism that Isolation seemed to have nailed in the game.And don't get me started on the final sequence.I left feeling like I had just watched Alvarez's rendition of the John Carpenter classic The Thing, which was also a far better move than this bowl of incandescent tripe.£40 bucks wasted having been also thoroughly disappointed with Deadpool vs. Wolverine, but that's another story.",2024-08-27
1098,mikeymike111,It's Ever So Slightly Better that Alien:Convenant,2,"While not the insult to the intelligence of Covenant (which gave us all the middle finger by bringing out of retirement the good twin/evil twin switcheroo) this is still very, very poor.It's basically a retread of Alien, but with younger less charismatic actors. There's three women who are pretty much interchangable, and two blokes ditto. The third bloke who's sweet-natured at least has some presence and isn't just your average dystopian-tough-talker that the rest of the cast conform to.However this character pointlessly, and actually slightly embarrassingly, uses Ripley's most famous line from Aliens but shorn of any anger or force it just comes across as slightly pathetic. Tonight's audience gave it a laugh, but it wasn't a supportive one - more a snort of derision.But above all the film is boring. It takes ages to establish the characters (which is pointless as they're not interesting) and then there's some competent scenes of the cast being chased by monsters and occasionally killed.The last iteration of the monster is the least scary the xenomorph has ever been. In fact it just looks a bit of an idiot. I think this is for plot reasons and it's supposed to tie in somehow with Prometheus. Now I usually shriek in a ladylike fashion at any jump scares (and did for the first two) but the last one I didn't even flinch simply because I was so bored and, if I'd not been with a friend, would have left the cinema way before it happened.The plot's slim but still vaguely confusing. Quite often I had no idea which part of the spaceship they were on or what they were trying to accomplish or where they were trying to steer it. It didn't matter, and it's possible it was made very clear but I wasn't paying attention out of being so disengaged from the whole thing.I wanted to like it. I thought that after the disaster of Covenant this was a chance to make a great Alien film. It's got no actual stupidity (apart from the Aliens quote) but then it's got no actor even one tenth as interesting as Michael Fassbender. Some of the monster attacks are slightly diverting.A massive disappointment. And also a film I will never, under any circumstances, watch again.Edit: I completely forgot that it does have its own wretched cliche, the 'of course! That's it!' moment when an innocent remark solves some major problem for the characters. The gentle-bloke character has the habit of telling jokes he know to be very bad. A trait he shares with about half a million other film/tv characters and such writing always causes the heart to sink. At some point he tells a joke about gravity which leads another character to say, in so many words, 'of course! That's it! Gravity!' which then helps them in some way I can't remember. I'm now going to say the film probably exactly on par with Alien: Covenant. But by this time tomorrow who knows? Perhaps it is actually the worst of the entire series.",2024-08-16
1099,ekolite,Standards have been lowered.,4,I did not find the computer generated Aliens to be nearly as scary as the original handmade models looked in the originals. I found only one likable character in this (Rain). I thought all the other characters were not very well thought out or well written for. If this is a 7.5 average it would have been a tops 5.5 25 years ago. This is in fact however not the worst Alien Movie I ever seen in theater. This trophy goes to Alien: Resurrection which I should have just left the theater.

The chatter upon leaving the theater confirmed the audience was not braindead and did indeed find the story insulting of their intelligence (there is hope for humanity).Romulus tapped into Alien DNA and then corrupted it, not unlike the black goo of Prometheus.

1101,adrenachrome,There is a great film buried in this garbage,4,"I will keep this short and spoiler free. There are some great ideas presented here that are buried beneath a film too afraid to stand on its own merits. There are so many references, both subtle, and blatant, to all the films in the franchise, that they detract greatly. Rather than being able to enjoy the film for what it was, the film advertised every step of the way where it was going and leading up to a reference, a phrase, a scene, or a plot device that was used to better effect in the prior films. It was tedious being able to predict what was going to happen before it did.Also, an overuse of crappy jump scares. There is a brilliant scene fairly early in the film that has potential for fantastic tension, and it was ruined by a cheap jump scare. This occurred several times throughout the film, breaking tension in what otherwise was a good scene
Also also, the third act was stupid. Full stop. A mishmash from the original Alien and Prometheus and as bad as that film was, it was better done than here.Total waste of potential. 4/10.",2024-08-17

Allot of it was fairly predictable although there were some things I don't think anybody could've seen coming from a mile away, leaving everybody in the cinema with their jaws on the floor.It really had the potential to be an amazing movie, and I'm not to say it wont be anybodies cup of tea, it just wasn't mine.",2024-08-15

The film attempts to do body horror but it falls short because it's nothing we didn't see in Prometheus or Alien Resurrection.

1107,robsonzoe,Disappointing,5,"As a long-time fan of the *Alien* franchise, I went into *Alien: Romulus* with a mix of excitement and trepidation. The franchise has seen its fair share of highs and lows over the years, with some entries becoming iconic pieces of cinematic history and others falling short of expectations. Unfortunately, *Alien: Romulus* seems to fall into the latter category. While the film has garnered significant praise from younger audiences-particularly those aged between their teens and late twenties-I found it lacking in several key areas.One of the most glaring issues with *Alien: Romulus* is its attempt to cater to a younger, more action-oriented audience at the expense of the franchise's roots in atmospheric horror and tension. The film is packed with high-octane action sequences and flashy special effects, but these elements often come at the cost of the slow-burn suspense that made the original *Alien* films so compelling. The story feels more like a generic sci-fi action flick than an *Alien* movie, with the iconic xenomorphs taking a backseat to a barrage of explosions, shootouts, and chase scenes.The plot, while ambitious, ultimately falls flat. *Alien: Romulus* tries to weave together multiple storylines, including the return of synthetic humans, a deep space mission gone awry, and a new, mysterious threat. However, rather than feeling cohesive, the film's narrative is disjointed and often confusing. It seems as though the filmmakers were trying to do too much in too little time, resulting in a story that is both overstuffed and underdeveloped. There are moments where the film hints at deeper themes-such as the nature of artificial intelligence and the ethics of human experimentation-but these ideas are never fully explored, leaving the audience with more questions than answers.The characters in *Alien: Romulus* are another weak point. Despite a talented cast, most of the characters come across as underdeveloped and unmemorable. They're little more than archetypes-the tough leader, the cocky pilot, the frightened scientist-rather than fully realized individuals with their own motivations and arcs. This is particularly disappointing in a franchise that has given us some of the most iconic characters in sci-fi history, like Ellen Ripley. The lack of character development makes it hard to care about what happens to them, which in turn diminishes the tension and stakes of the story.The one exception to this is Andy, the synthetic human. In a film filled with forgettable characters, Andy stands out as the most interesting and complex. His internal struggle between his programmed duties and his growing sense of self-awareness is one of the few aspects of the film that feels genuinely engaging. Andy's journey raises intriguing questions about what it means to be human, a theme that has always been central to the *Alien* franchise. However, even Andy's character is not given the depth or screen time he deserves, leaving his story feeling incomplete and somewhat wasted.Despite its shortcomings, *Alien: Romulus* does have its moments. The special effects are top-notch, with the xenomorphs looking more terrifying than ever. The film's visual design is impressive, capturing the bleak, industrial aesthetic that has become a hallmark of the franchise. There are also a few genuinely suspenseful scenes that harken back to the original *Alien*, reminding the audience of the series' horror roots. However, these moments are few and far between, buried under layers of action set-pieces and convoluted plotting.Another issue with the film is its reliance on nostalgia. While it's understandable that the filmmakers would want to pay homage to the earlier films in the franchise, *Alien: Romulus* often feels like it's trying too hard to recapture the magic of the original without bringing anything new to the table. The callbacks to previous films, while initially exciting, quickly become tiresome, as they seem to serve as a crutch rather than a meaningful part of the story.Ultimately, *Alien: Romulus* feels like a missed opportunity. While it's clear that the filmmakers had ambitious ideas, the execution leaves much to be desired. The film seems to be resonating with younger audiences, perhaps because of its action-heavy approach and slick visuals, but for long-time fans of the franchise, it's likely to be a disappointment. The only aspect of the film that I found truly compelling was the character of Andy, the synthetic human, but even he couldn't carry the film on his own.In conclusion, I would advise long-time *Alien* fans to manage their expectations before watching *Alien: Romulus*. It's a film that, while visually impressive, ultimately falls short in terms of story, character development, and emotional impact. If you're looking for a film that recaptures the tension and horror of the original *Alien*, this isn't it. Save your money and wait for a film that does justice to the legacy of this iconic franchise.",2024-08-16

The ending was very bad. They could have made it better rather than a human-like alien. The plot lacked depth and the pacing was off, making it hard to stay engaged.

1109,Ms-DzEN,Was it actually THAT good?,5,"Yes, I think Romulus was okay, around 5.5 territory. I know my rating may look low for avid Alien fans but I think movie is dragging and super predictable as generic slasher. I actually had a bit more fun with dumbfest that Covenant was, it was so stupid that kinda entertaining. My huge disappointment of Covenant was because of my huge expectations that it would be a good movie, silly me. I didn't have any expectations with Romulus at all, and I think Fede did a great job with Evil Dead a while ago, but I was not particularly certain he is the right fit for franchise. And in terms of Alien part, I think he nailed the monster design and suspense was there at times, but other than that... oh boy, it just misses the mark. I just don't think I vibe with movie message and characters. They tried to do their backstories, and portray them less cliche as possible but it did not work out that much. It is very predictable movie where even ending itself won't surprise much after seeing Scott's movies. You still have a super dumb character, a hero protector character, obvious first prey character and so on. Probably slightly the better one among them was old junky android. He had some rough development but I still dig him more than others. Where also movie fails flat for me... it looks somewhat cheap, and sometimes very cheap (yeah that particular character). Of course it won't be a big deal if it was fan-made movie, or movie for streaming platforms, right? And yes, I could not leave the feeling it's also fan-made in a good way, I see a lot of passion and care from Fede but I don't enjoy the story he presents, it does not show anything new about the world, it's just pale. Granted it takes main inspiration from the first Alien movie but it felt even too much at times. It's almost like a soft re-boot, and why should I care when there is always a superior one.I know it's a different media, but there is a videogame Dark Descent which was made by a small studio, and... they simply nailed it. A true love letter to fans of Aliens. Whether Romulus is a love letter to Alien or just a mediocre copy-cat, your guess as good as mine.",2024-08-21
1110,Chris_Ego,A safe bet,5,"Truth to be told: like any new adaptation of a cult movie it won't ever be more impactful than the original. Take ""Terminator"", ""Evil Dead"", ""Halloween"" or any other 80s cult classic - the first film was always the best one! Even if the same directors, cast or crew was on board, there is something special about the debut that a sequel would not match up.The alien franchise never needed more, but since Ridley Scott had his hands in the game, it was his decision to tell more stories.Fede Alvarez, the director of ""Alien: Romulus"" (2024) was facing a difficult task. Not only is the franchise a very sensitive one. It is hard to piss off fans, critics and studio bosses, if you fail to make a good movie with a cult universe, that ""Alien"" is. Fede is also a big fan and admirer of how all Alien movies turned out. I think he did his best to present ""Romulus"" in the vintage fashion with spaceship models, old CRT monitors and the design we all know from the first two Alien movies. He used CGI only where needed. The lighting was great. He nailed the atmoshere perfectly. He even assembled the old team of puppeteers to get the original Alien Xenomorph on screen.That being said, my only concern was the young cast. Even when R. Scott was intrigued by the idea, the execution with a cast consisting of numerous nobodies (with the exeption of Archie Renaux) went South. It was unbelievable that these youngsters could embark on a stellar mission undetected. From the beginning they act without integrity. Just a bad choice of actors! You just wish they would get caught in a trap but they survive for so long! It is painful. The best scene was when Cailee Spaeny (as ""Rain"", not Sigourneys daughter in no way or fashion) was backed by David Jonsson (as the adorable android ""Andy"") when shooting in anti gravity. Andy was a great character and got the best character development in the script. David Jonsson played him gracefully. Robert Bobroczkyi is scary as hell, trust me!The rest of the movie was a hommage to the original movie in terms of look, music and feel. Composer Benjamin Wallfisch was sure told to reuse themes and motifs we know from exisiting Alien movies. He quotes the themes and uses new brushes. Nothing too experimental. Some famous scenes were reimagined (the greasey Alien next to a face, the female protagonist shoot from below when exiting a door holding a gun in her hand looking fierce, etc.). This is why Alien: Romulus is a safe bet. The franchise hasn't been ruined but we also didn't need this one. Just return to the DVD of the original 3.",2024-08-21

Or if you want a star wars analogy- if Prometheus was Ridley's prequel trilogy. This film is Solo.How did Ridley even let his name be put on this film? Planetary rings do not act like giant grinding wheels. Spaceships do not coast to a stop when you turn off the engine. The aliens are scared of guns except when they aren't so you can do an unnecessary call back to aliens.But then this script is pretty much all call backs- famous bits from the plots of each successful alien film, iconic lines thrown about with abandon, nothing original at all.",2024-11-02
1112,Blazehgehg,Way too derivative,5,"For the first 30-40 minutes, this was a great movie. A really interesting look at colonist life under the thumb of Weyland-Utani. The characters it sets up are interesting, their situation feels fresh and it makes sense they want to give the company the middle finger.Unfortunately, once we're full swing in being an Alien movie, it feels like it probably fell prey to executive meddling, because the next hour and a half is almost non-stop references to other, better movies. The only thing scarier than a xenomorph is the studio being afraid that it's been more than 10 minutes without referencing something they've already done before. There are multiple, extended, repeated tips of the hat to everything from the first movie all the way up through Alien 3, Alien Resurrection and Prometheus.And not in a cute sort of ""it's lore!"" way, either. I mean there are characters that dress, do, or say things just because it's from one of the previous movies. It is a cowardly lack of originality.Every now and then you catch glimpses of the movie we saw in the first act. A little bit of that creativity seeps back in. It is then immediately followed by someone yelling ""Get away from her, you (...)"" in maybe the single most out-of-character moment I've seen in a movie in my entire life. But they said the thing. Remember the thing? From the other movie? They said it here too! That's cool, right?That kind of stuff wears you down. Even when Romulus is being new, creative and interesting, it slowly stops mattering. It simultaneously feels like a movie made for people who have never seen an Alien movie, and for people who have obsessively re-watched every Alien movie. It struggles to find a common ground between the two, and that kind of unraveled the whole thing for me.",2024-10-28

This should be common for any movie, but in today's CGI fashion it looks unusually pleasant. * Photo of Ian McKellen crying *Cons:Lack of chemistry between the characters. Marketing killed the idea long time ago. The scriptwriters have completely forgotten how to show emotions with classic techniques (they are often replaced by sex, hysterics, etc.). You just don't care when someone dies.Genre eclecticism that is falling apart before our eyes. First they show us a dystopia. It develops into a thriller. Suddenly, they reveal all the secrets in the middle of the film. (Spoilers inside the script? What a genius idea!) Later they try to create suspense, which turns out to be banal fan service. In the end there is a sudden action, which violates the logic of everything that happened in the franchise.Lack of logic. The aliens are not the unknown scary things that can't be taken down by a platoon of space marines, now they are targets for a loli who is shooting for the first time in her life. ""Alright, I'm low on bullets, everybody scooch together!"" - that should be the tagline.Boring android. Synths outperformed the cast in all previous chapters, but this time you want to turn the movie off when he's on the screen.For some reason, they show the aliens in close-up, revealing all the shortcomings of the rubber suits.The operating principle of some devices is questionable. For example, the extremely strange butt of the gun, which clasps (!) the shoulder.The aliens grow enormously fast at all stages of development.

According to all the hype it sits with Alien and Aliens but is nowhere near to them.I can see why some may say this with the feel and mood looking similar to Aliens, with real effects (not relying on CGI) but that's where the good points stop. Literally mimicking iconic scenes form Aliens is not good enough, for god same make it you own.The story could have been good but it needed more space to create the tension. Unfortunately this falls into the relentless modern action trap the dopamine generation demands. Events unfolding quickly but without clarity. The acting is average, there is not real depth to the characters and you're not invested in their story.Prometheus is a far better film than this, much more captivating and with more purpose.The ending was unforgivable with the Xeno-human nonsense rearing its ugly head. Ridiculous!I could have overlooked some of the other failures of the movie but this tipped it over the edge, a lame villain and boring end we've seen a million times.I have given it 3 because of the mood it tried to recapture from Aliens but paying homage is not enough, the rest of it was badly executed.

I kept comparing it back to Aliens 1986 while I watched and its 40 year old predecessor is a far superior movie. The storyline was predictable and with the exception of David Johnson, the acting was just okay. Johnson is the bright spot in this cast and was excellent in his portrayal of Andy. The rest of the cast was unremarkable. I'm curious where the $80m budget went because many of the sets seemed washed out and without detail. There were a few nice nostalgic feels in the movie from sounds and equipment that took you back to Alien 1979. But it just felt like an Alien movie done on the cheap. The IMDB rating is pretty high right now for Romulus but these days, who knows what to believe in these ratings. It seems like a lot of people are pumping it up to praise the director. I'm giving you an honest opinion about the movie. Not bad, but not great either. You won't watch it twice and if you don't see it, you're missing anything.",2024-08-16

As each one dies I care less about the ones left.The obligatory android looks like he's going to burst in tears all the time. Honestly, his eyes were so upside down puppy-like that he should have been called Cuddle me now before I cry.It tries to keep anyone who's seen the other films interested by throwing in shout outs to earlier instalments. The original android is there but is portrayed with such bad CGI that it looks like it was made on a ZX Specrum computer (shout out to all those old people like me who grew up using one). A crude interpretation of one of the 'creators' from the earlier instalment, for no real reason was also thrown into the mix.No storyline. No direction. No point. No horror.I watched it with a look of bemusement on my face. I couldn't believe what I was when it finished I wanted to take a hammer to my tv in case it infected any of the good films that I might watch on it in the future.If you think it was a good addition to the franchise, then you must be easily pleased. If I didn't know better I would have thought it was a fan based film made by some students in a garage due to the acting and plot. Thrown my money at it to give it a good scenic over good look doesn't help when you have no storyline.I have never fealt the need to vent about a film on until now. So that should let you know the depth of my loathing for this 'film'. It's so bad that I feel my affection for the previous films has been violated.

The story line makes no sense; why does the alien take humanoid form when every other time it maintains its original form? I don't know what they were going for with this, but if it was to make money, I hope they were successful. If it was to perpetuate the Alien franchise, they killed it.

There isn't anything new or worth exciting in this movie except Andy's character being a bit different. There is also a great failure of logic the way the alien evolves super fast.

What actors? It was supposed to have the atmosphere of Alien: Resurrection... yeah, well, it's just terrible 🙂. The movie seems aimed at brainless young people. For seasoned fans, it's a major letdown. I've said my piece. I won't say more because it's not worth wasting any more time on this awful movie. Ripley was right when she asked if the IQ level suddenly dropped while she was asleep for half a century. The best comparison to this is the last Romulus-a steaming pile of garbage made for the brain-dead, iPhone-obsessed generation, who thought it was a good idea to lie on the sidewalks in major US and EU cities with a facehugger mask on their faces, pretending to be an Alien victim in broad daylight.Only 5 stars for CGI.",2024-11-14

But I think I have by watching the trailer. Are we rooting for the Alien? Because the cast looks annoying ;).Fan of the franchise but after Aliens they have missed the mark (I'll throw the Alien Predator movies in there as well). If its back to horror than I guess that's ok, but Aliens went action movie and it improved on the original. But successful risk taking isn't going well in Hollywood, so back to the beginning I guess.I like the no name cast (or should I know them?). They are all sacrificial lambs.

Because it was pure, unadultered sci-fi horror, yet subtle, suspenseful. The characters, their motivations and personalities all naturally established themselves.Ash too you suspected something was of with - as someone who might have some case of high-functionining autism?Even after the big reveal on the truth of Ash, he remained an artificial person of few words; it was shown how coldly calculating he was - but all in service of Waylan-Yutani. Yet he did have something of a (programmed) human element to it:""I can't lie about your chances, but you do have my sympathy.""Here a poorly CGI crafted Ian Holm is re-introduced as Ash again. The writing for him is however so on-the-nose, so ridiculous...so full of over exposition. Again, Ash was a man of few words, and only when compelled to answer.Here he goes on and on as if feeling a need to justify his actions. That simply does not jive with the single-minded part Ian Holm once played.The rest of the cast too is hardly memorable. That it was a full cast of all teenagers makes me suspect this was a movie drafted by committee - and very much gave it Disney-vibes.Not at all the movie I had hoped it to be. Maybe just leave the Alien franchise well enough alone, or put it in cryo-stasis for.... I dunno...80 years or so?There was one big plus I took away from this movie, and for whom alone I probably reserve 2 out of these 4 stars.

In disbelief. And not in a good way.I was kinda hopeful for this one, I liked the visuals from the trailers, it seemed to have the correct early Alien atmosphere (it did!). The only red flag was the all Gen Z cast and well - I was right about that. The movie did needed and older (disgruntled) mentor guy or at least a guy like Elgyn in Alien R, that was a Leader. We had one guy but he was not really this person.The movie's first hour I enjoyed, despite the modern Hollywood ""create dumb problems to present even dumber solutions"" writing moments, which were all emphasized on later, when the third act went off the rails and the second third act went I don't know even where (if you've seen ""Tropic Thunder"" you'll know where). But we still needed to get there through member berry after member berry after member berry to get to that third and second third acts. To be rewarded with even more member berries. At this point I was tired and annoyed by this. Especially that pulse rifle ""training"" scene and the dialogue that was ""supporting"" it. Jesus wept...MILD spoilers ahead:It was like the screenwriter tried to mesh every movie in the ALIEN franchise in this one flick (as a tribute, I guess) and it is an absolute disaster. Would have worked better if we had just one xenomorph, maybe two. And we ended with a hive that did not really made sense because of the way the first hour of the movie was written.And then we got THE SECOND third act where... I can't even start to explain. We got a way, WAY WORSE version of the Alien R ending, mixed with some Prometheus black goo-ness.Friends, this one is scraping the bottom of the barrel with ""Covenant"" for me, and while the latter one bored me to tears, this one REALLY pissed me off.

The scare factor was off the charts with really visceral moments like the alien bursting out of the chest etc.,This movie on the other hand is a pale shadow of the original movies. They problem is not with the story or even the actors. Rather, the issue was with the theme being redundant. It's been reused so many times that, it does not give a visceral jolt of a horror movie anymore.To be fair, the movie makers have realized it while making the movie and introduced some scenes of body horror where they have one of the characters in this movie inject the alien genetic material while being pregnant, resulting in something hideous. But, it looked like something which was copied from movies like ""Species"", rather than anything original.The other issue was the attempt to recreate the 80s style technology while trying to show the futuristic space exploration & mining, with it. It just doesn't work, when you try to make outdated tech do things that we now know is impossible.

The creature designs are solid, but the actors just aren't very convincing. I think the film would have profited more with some senior actors who would have given the film and the story more seriousness.The story itself is not so bad, but it is spoiled by the unnecessary melodrama with the android. This was handled much better in the previous films.Cailee Spaeny is no Sigourney Weaver, and besides, she looks like she's 12 years old. Sigourney Weaver was a believable character, with her fears and desire to survive, along with her maternal instinct.

Fans of the Alien movies will enjoy the many MANY easter eggs and callbacks throughout the film. Most of which were tastefully done while others beat you over the head with them (""Remember?! Remember that scene from that movie you liked? See? We're doing that here. Isn't that cool??"")The characters were pretty two dimensional with a couple of exceptions. I would have given the movie a solid 6 or 6.5 that is until the third act where it just turned to dreck.Positives: The set, prop and creature teams were obvious fans of the lore and really did a good job of pulling off the aesthetics of the first two films. Dialog wasn't horrible but won't win any awards either. Character development was weak except for two of the crew. A surprise cameo was decently done and did actually fit within the story structure. The music was well done but nothing noteworthy.The bad: It's dark, very dark in every scene. Not AVP: Requiem dark (iykyk) but dark nonetheless. Other than a couple of minor plot points, there really wasn't anything new to showcase. Most of the cast have very thick British accents which, if you are going deaf like me, makes them very difficult to understand over the music and background noise. Finally, the third act. Don't get me started on the third act. I was good with the story progression until that last 30 minutes where it really felt like the writers threw their hands up and said ""Welp, we're out of ideas"".Still, it was better than Alien 4, Prometheus and Alien Covenant. So there's that at least. If you are a fan of the first two Alien movies and/or Alien Isolation, you might enjoy this film. Or...save your $$$ and wait until it's streaming.Final verdict? 5/10.

1139,petersjoelen,kids in space,5,"Kids in space , that is the first thought that crossed my mind during the film , if this is an attempt by Fede Alvarez to try to recreate the atmosphere of the original film then he has not succeeded very well .I found myself not being able to bond much with the characters, there was no camaraderie that you saw being built up in the original, such as in the dinner scene.Admittedly Alvaraz has tried, on a technical level, but it takes more than dark corridors,
rain and the same gadgets on board to recreate the atmosphere, bringing Ian Holm back with AI was also not a great idea, but it gets even worse during the The end of the film goes completely off track with a stupid plot twist that feels super unnecessary.Ultimately, this new part made me leave the cinema with quite a hangover.",2024-08-24
1140,michael-gepp,For beginners only!,5,"Watched it today as it opened in Brazil. Very stupid film! I was expecting much much more, after the absence from previous show. Boring, predictable. Director, previously unknown to me, decided to use same ideas, scenes and quotes from previous films in the franchise. That might impact or attract new viewers. I knew exactly what characters would do or say before their scenes happened. I hope they definitely lay the subject to rest and never think of a sequel. Film for dumb beginners only! Watch at your own risk. I do not recommend it at all. I rather watch the first three films from the franchise!",2024-08-15
1141,dutyfirst-22466,Middle of the road Alien film.,5,"I rank this somewhere between 4 and 3. Disliked the cast in its entirety and wasn't feeling the teenage antics with aliens. Andy is the most useless bot with his seizure meltdowns, by the end it was overbearing. Perhaps an unpopular opinion going by the reception but I sincerely don't think this was so much a love letter for fans of the Alien movies as it was some kind of Gen Z reboot. The zero gravity dodging the acid blood scene was the end of my rope when it came to this film. Nonsensical action, uninteresting characters who couldn't hold a candle to the original cast. Finding it really hard to barely rate this film better than 4.",2024-09-30

I loved each of them installments. Of course they are unequal but all in all they are unsurpassed in the Sci-Fi genre, or only maybe by Interstellar, if we can even compare the genres... But this? I mean what is this piece of turd and why does it bear the name of the franchise? Who is the idiot that let that happen? You bring a low costs bunch of kids and some CGI and you think you can join the legend? Unbearable. I promised myself I would try because, well you know, I am a fan and all, but hell after 20 minutes I was stomping my feet on the ground. Casting these kids is wrecking the good name Alien!",2024-12-03
1143,Krys1984Kasp,Really?,5,"I watched it and I think it could have been a nice movie. It was quite good, until the last act which ruined the entire previous impressions, and therefore the whole movie. There is no way to compare to the ""old"" aliens. For me it's only better than Prometheus , and the next one, which was so great that I even forgot the title. Convenant? I guess so. It's not a high bar. Zero atmosphere, no building any tension. I only felt a thrill during the scene where they drift surrounded by acid... Characters that differ only in appearance and names. Paradoxically, the most human and developed character is probably the android Andy. Not a single ""scary"" scene. I really don't know what people are raving about... it seems that the requirements/expectations are so low now... seriously, movies are getting worse.",2024-08-28
1144,Steeler92,Yawn,4,It's another uninspired Alien movie filled with WB level young actors. The story is ridiculous. The characters are one dimensional and unlikable. Really Andy is the only decent character in the whole movie. This movie really added nothing to the stories we've already seen. Through most of the movie I played on my phone because it didn't keep my attention (I'm typing this towards the end of the movie if that says anything). I now find myself rooting for the Aliens because the characters are so annoying. Rain is really horrible. Having to add more characters (letters in this case) because I have to write a novel per the rules.,2024-11-24
1145,dakjets,How to surpass a masterpiece? It is impossible,5,"I grew up with the Alien movies. Although I was too young to enter the cinema in 1979, I still got to see the film as an 11-year-old. My cousin arranged to rent it on video (remember video rentals?). The film made me both interested in the sci fi genre and horror films. An interest that has remained throughout my life. The claustrophobic, intense original film from 1979 was and is groundbreaking.The action-oriented sequel from 1986 was also very successful in that it maintained the horror effects of the original, mixed with magnificent action scenes.Later the downturns began. Guess if you're still reading this review you know what I mean.With this film, my expectations were turned up. Maybe too much? I watched the movie with a friend who doesn't have the same interest in these movies as I do. He liked this movie. I thought it was exciting and scary. I understand why he means that, but it's not good enough for me.The film functions as an action-packed scifi adventure and our ""friends"" Aliens of course appear and do what they usually do. Although the film makes many references to previous films, this is not enough for me.I think the nerve in the film cannot compare to the two original films. It will be a dime a dozen in line with comparable films. It lacks the unique thing that made the original film a masterpiece: the ability to scare the life out of us.And then it's a fact, I can't avoid it; an Alien film will NEVER be the same (and as good) without Sigourney Weaver. Sorry, that's just the way it is.",2024-09-19
1146,gtrd-06740,Nothing new,3,This movie is just yet another example of modern films lacking creativity. I'm a fan of the alien franchise but like most modern iterations they simply rehash old ideas and hope nostalgia blinds the viewer of this fact. There is plenty of options they could of used for this film but chose to ignore them or they could of used influences from the expanded world from the books but sadly that is asking to much. As gory and decent action scenes it unfortunately does not save the film in my opinion. Hopefully one day this franchise will be revived and brought back to the levels of the original or at the very least to the levels of aliens or even alien 3 for that matter.,2024-08-18
1147,Old_School_Gamer,Complete Copy of Old Alien Movies,1,Are you kidding? They basically stole every scene from all of the previous Alien movies from the past 30 years. Is this supposed to be a good movie? I literally was laughing every 10 minutes or so throughout the movie because the scenes were exact duplicates from other Alien movies in the franchise.I am very surprised that Ridley Scott would even consider making something that is in this poor of taste. Save yourself a lot of disappointment and time and money and go watch something else because this movie is an exact replica of other movies that preceded it. On top of that the acting was terrible and the story was completely boring period.Horrible!!!,2024-12-03

I love Cailee Spaeny and have seen most of her work, so I mostly saw this for her. She impressed as usual, however I can't say the same for a single other actor in this story line. It wasn't particularly well written, most of the characters are inexplicably inept yet simultaneously crafty at other times, making them all highly dislikeable and definitely immature with little to no backstory. While Andy isn't a bad character, you wonder why they included him at all or made the choices they did with his story arch. It's definitely not a movie for anyone looking for interesting dialogue, but then, the last Alien movies that tried that also failed. Some scenes were decent enough for a horror flick, but this was a disappointment in XD. They didn't have the funds to make the aliens look half as good as previous ones, which was the only other reason to go. Just save yourself the time and watch Alien Resurrection for real fun and character development.",2024-08-22
1149,Rabid_dog-sr,David Jonsson Saves This Movie,4,"With nods to Prometheus, alien and the wider universe this starts off with good intent. A cameo that lasted too long and a take on a famous line from Aliens that was all unnecessary.When will the final shot of a aliens movie end with a xenomorph punching through a skull of a hero looking up to see a ship descending with the audience knowing what horror awaits the crew and the credits roll leaving us wanting more?Romulus isn't a bad film, it just doesn't do anything unexpected. The end scenes are disturbing but no more so than ressurection. A retread of alien isn't what we needed but its what we got.Andy, well Andys portrayal was fantastic and Mr Jonsson did for alien Romulas Sigourney did for alien.Watch it with an open mind but don't expect a new classic.",2024-08-21
1150,cvkwqgrsg,If you like Alien/Aliens keep clear,4,"Alien Romulus certainly looks the part and has an interesting initial premise with some good acting performances, along with interesting sets and locations.However, like so many modern films in longstanding series/franchise, it can't help but dredge up bits we all loved from the classics in place of creating new things. In here we have multiple lines directly taken from Alien and Aliens (very famous ones) just jammed in as poor fan service, which is extremely jarring and also takes some of the meaning and gravity they once had and dilutes it. It also fails to create any real tension past its first act devolving into a nice looking slasher type film where the only thing moving the plot forward is the characters acting totally illogically.The third act pulls in some Prometheus elements and does do something new, but in all honesty I wish these elements and the whole Prometheus side of things just be left out of the alien franchise as it mainly degrades the alien itself and new doesn't always mean good.It overall plays like a poor imitation of an alien film that tries to use direct elements from the classics to elevate itself, tainting this film and tarnishing the legacy it is aiming to add to.To me the best entries into this series are still easily Alien, Aliens and Alien:isolation (game). This is a well made but shallow representation of what alien can be and while it is happy to heavily ""borrow"" elements from the original films I wish someone would borrow their fairly basic plot and suspense/tension building instead and give us a true Alien film.",2024-08-22

The acting was good
The story was great
The introduction of a new xenomorph was awesome!Cons:
You can't see anything actually happening because the lighting in the movie is terrible. There are tons of face hugger and xenomorph action but the lighting is so bad you can't see most of it happening. The movie tries to give fans all the things that made the first two movies amazing but falls flat because of the seizer inducing flashes of darkness and low lit light. No joke, the med Bay, the command center, and the mission room are all lit with bright lights but the hallways, elevator shafts and engine rooms don't have anything but two red lights. I get it, I do. You want this movie to have plenty of jump scares but what's better than a jump scare? Seeing the freaking aliens!!!This isn't 1979, we know what the creatures are.

So all we had was a bunch of teenies. No jumpscare, no good fighting scene, no scary moments, everything was a bit lame because it's an alien movie for beginners of this genre filled with teens.

1158,inc-133-70013,Poor man's Alien,5,"Alien: Romulus is what you hear, if you ask a person who watched original Alien those 46 years ago what the movie was about, and if they didn't particularly care about it.""There's spaceship, female protagonist, an android, evil company and spooky monsters"".That's exactly what also exists in Alien: Romulus. But (unlike the original movie), it's also all there is.All the characters are very poor NPC's from 1990's video game, I don't think I remember a single name. One is unexplainably evil, one is very scared, so on. They don't even try to be memorable anyhow, there's no notable dialogue, backgrounds, anything.They're supposedly indentured slaves on some mining planet, but also have a (probably cargo hauling) spaceship they can just ride whenever they feel like it.And they also die really fast.Main character definitely isn't Sigourney Weaver, even if she tries a bit. Most of the budget for this move probably went to CRT screens, and couple - I admit - pretty nice exterior shots of a space station grinding down on asteroid belt. There's also pretty poor attempt to explain gravity in Alien movies, and it's used to make a pretty memorable scene with free-floating acid. But that also happens be only original thought in entire movie.Well, and that Weyland-Yucatani corporation's scientists and researchers are most gullible, if not idiotic people in the galaxy, because you can put babies of ""ultimate lifeform, a vicious alien predator"" into shrink-wraps and just leave them hanging around... well not even once. My point is, there's some creative compromises as a storytelling tool, and there's something so utterly dumb that nobody will buy it. Alien: Romulus showcases a lot of the latter. Two robots in this movie seemed to have more self-preservation instinct than humans themselves. But that's also partly due really poor acting.Rest is... well... it's a (somewhat embarrassing) high school play on theme of Alien, that's about the best way to put it.

The shout-outs to other Alien films too many to mention and, worse, cringe worthy and embarrassing.The storyline was a horrible mix of previous movies. If they couldn't come up with something at least marginally tense and original then they'd have been better off not bothering at all.At this point, I don't think it's too much to say that the franchise is dead in the water and needs to be left well alone.

Impressive scenarios and photography that highlight a poorly explained story. It's a false remake made for another young type of audience. A casting and a film not for all audiences and cinephile wisdom like Alien (1979).It starts off in an outstanding way, surprising with its nostalgia, its art and its settings, but soon begins to lose strength when you understand that it is not a horror film and Alien does not come to say anything or generate anything; a character as expected as he is forgotten.Much impressive continent with not plausible content.",2024-08-24

What a way to ruin a good pudding that equally made zero sense. I wanted chocolate, and you gave me vegetables. I left the cinema feeling rather short changed and bitterly disappointed in a movie that has been hyped up so much. Don't get me wrong, it has its moments and there are plenty subtle, and not so subtle, nods to the other movies, but we all wanted chocolate and it does not deliver.

1170,Democrit,"""Alien"" in a cocoon and the space birth of an engineer",5,"The movie did not arouse any emotions in me: no fear, no anxiety, and especially no empathy. I had no one to empathize with: neither the heroine, who suffered the whole picture with one facial expression from the oppression of the corporation and tried to survive on the station, nor the android, who tried to please the heroine with a childish grimace and constantly broke down. He constantly had to be wound up like a toy in order for him to continue functioning. This child's play with a spring in the neck has become some kind of obsession that reflects the creative confusion and shakiness of Disney.The movie is a refined, emotionless theater with stuffed xenomorphs and rubber facehuggers bouncing like balls. All the actors are walking functions that do nothing but move through the plot, die like flies and do not carry any content. I can't call this a fascinating movie, it's just some kind of functional jumble of alternating events. None of what I saw excited me, I did not empathize with anyone. There is no soul in the film, no creativity, only an aesthetic pasteurized picture. Yes, this film does not need a director, this film would only need a few cameramen who would shoot according to the storyboard. Don't be angry, fans of Fede Alvarez: the director completely forgot about human emotions, he was so stuck trying to mask the plot hole that he couldn't think of anything better than bricking up a dead alien from the first part in a ton of mounting foam. This is really a fetish of a fantastic scale: an alien who was pierced with a giant harpoon, fried with a jet engine that dangled in the vacuum of space, managed to wrap himself in a giant cocoon! Who came up with this? A circle of young scouts? Or patients with obsessive disorder?I would like to remember ""Aliens"" a little bit James Cameron, because the audience is still arguing which picture is better, the first one or Cameron's. So, I would like to remind you how Cameron built the plot. He didn't just send the heroes to the lair of monsters, he invented a surviving child, he motivated Ripley to take care of her, sacrifice himself to save her. And what is Alvarez doing? He is in a hurry to reveal the intrigue, does not reveal the character of the characters, comes up with superficial quarrels instead of deep conflicts. His station is deserted, there is only a stub of a poorly animated android, from which he makes an antagonist, glues a cheap scarecrow to the ceiling and highlights it with a hole so that it is impossible to see the cheapness of a foam doll, places facehuggers in uncontrolled incubators so that they run around the laboratory, accelerates the metabolism of monsters to seconds and enjoys metal dentures of a xenomorph watering his liters of fake slime, and someone thinks it's a good idea?Before the premiere, I assumed that there would be engineers in the film, but what we were shown was some kind of cocaine hallucinogenic seizure of dying brain cells affected by a malignant tumor. We were shown a hybrid of an engineer and a human, which appeared as a result of the introduction of alien DNA into the body of a pregnant woman who did it voluntarily. Alvarez believed that any pregnant woman would inject an incomprehensible liquid into herself, that she was so irresponsible that she did not care about the child's health at all. The station is filled with predatory individuals who were raised by the staff of this laboratory, and she is injecting herself with a harmless black vitamin, which was invented by the same psycho scientists. This pregnant girl is a completely unnecessary character, she has no influence on the plot, except for the birth of an overgrown hybrid, she has no interesting dialogues, no personality, nothing - the whole movie makes her sick, and in the finale she gives birth to this miracle yudo.Am I the only one who has cognitive dissonance with such data? Does anyone really take such nonsense seriously?All this nonsense does not create a mysterious atmosphere in any way, does not create prerequisites for suspense.Do you know why Alvarez decided that the heroes would not be able to find the necessary amount of fuel at the huge station? Yes, only because in the open final to immerse the heroine in suspended animation and leave a bold reference. As I said, this movie is a jumble of features.Alvarez's xenomorphs began to flex and pose like models on the catwalk, they are no longer swift and deadly - they are now just as full-fledged
The characters are happy to pose as in a photo shoot. Am I the only one who is amused by this whole circus with wipers on the windows and with the only spaceship operated by sophomores? The space station is in orbit, and no one sees it point-blank - only our heroes are plowing through outer space, and the government of the planet and the corporation have withdrawn themselves and flew away to bask on the sunny azure shores. This is plot nonsense, which is sewn with white thread with patches of Ridley Scott's underpants.Even the third film, which was not allowed to be shot by David Fincher and which was edited without his participation, looks more interesting and emotional.The film has good scenery and pleasant toning of the image, good camerawork - I didn't see anything else good. The film has a very mediocre beginning: a foam cocoon; a heroine who had to suffer from the loss of her parents, from unbearably hard work, but we were not shown this. So she woke up, had breakfast and was already flying to the station. No obstacles, no obstacles - everything is fast and easy. Only they quarreled because of the android and then for fun, for half a second - it's just a childish conflict, and this scene can't even be called a conflict. The director does not feel at all and does not know how to evoke sympathy or empathy, and he clearly has problems with association. It is impossible for the viewer to compare his ""I"" with any of the characters.I don't think the movie is bad, it's not bad or good - you know, it feels like you don't care. It's the same with this movie.",2024-08-31
1171,lnmrocha,A tremendous disappointment,3,"A tremendous disappointmentI went into the movie theater with enormous illusions and expectations. I left with even greater disappointment. The script is OK. The characters' lines are OK. But the characters are not OK. They lack character, personality, attitude and empathy. A Sigourney Weaver is missing. There's a lack of recognized actors who bring more depth to the film. They never managed to recreate the sinister, cold atmosphere of the Nostromo. Not even the colonists' dormitories on the station at LV-426.It's just another sci-fi horror movie with a monster that kills humans. For anyone who is a true fan and has seen all the other Aliens dozens of times... this movie is not acceptable.",2024-08-26
1172,LuisRCancel,How to End a Franchise,4,"I have been a diehard fan of the Alien film franchise ever since Ridley Scott scared the living daylights out of me with the first film. So it saddens me to admit that Alien: Romulus has fallen so far in quality, creativity, and storytelling, that I will NEVER see another Alien film again. This is nothing but rehashed Slasher type setups with steamship settings for a backdrop. Who would ever guess that space ships, even mining ships, would look like giant boiler rooms for ocean liners. There's minimal science here, only enough to convey the possible greed motive of the almighty corporation. If you're a fan of the Alien franchise, stay away from the funeral.",2024-08-16
1173,rsr-14,"For the young, naive and inexperienced",3,"After seeing this movie, I'm fully convinced there are only 2 Alien movies - the first from the 1970s, and its sequel.Romulus simply seems dumb, not sure how this movie ever got accepted for the story.Good things first - effects are fine, I did appreciate the main character Rain and her android Andy.Remaining characters felt like young and uneducated, very simple language too, constantly saying the f-word, it gets tiresome in minutes. In the first Alien movie you also had uneducated personnel seemingly like truck drivers, but they behaved much more realistic and convincingly, and they were older, not like the Romulus-teenagers. Surely no Oscar goes to Romulus for the extremely bad acting.Maybe easier if I just mention the questions I had when watching this movie.1. People are more or less grounded on the planet by the Weyland corporation. How do some young, poor and dumb teenage-ish persons get access to an expensive spaceship and are able to fly it off-planet? Is Weyland really allowing grounded persons to fly wherever they want? Does not make much sense.2. In the first Alien movie we see that from face-hugging to chest-bursting that takes about 1 day - or 24 hours. Why did it take 5 minutes in Romulus?3. In the original Alien movie, it took days for the alien the reach full size - sure it grew fast, and it shed its skin several time. The alien ate to grow. In Romulus the alien grows full size in a few minutes - and it does not eat to grow. So it now grows using air like a balloon?Same for the monster at the end - grows to a gigantic size in minutes without really eating anything. Simply stupid - the director could easily have built in some time pauses in the movie to show time has passed like a few days. The Alien growth rate is totally unrealistic in Romulus.4. Reusing old one-liners like ""You have my sympathies"" among other sentences just felt dumb and out of place. Do reuse old stuff - try to make new great stuff instead.5. The movie felt like designed by some dude making video games - like the flying through acid, having to pull four levers etc. Romulus may indeed have worked better as a game than a movie.6. Worst thing about this movie was constantly rushing things - alien grows to full size in minutes, most of the movie happens in 40 minutes. This rush destroys the movie, breaks rules from previous movies - and turns Romulus into an implausible mess of a story. Also it kind consists of parts we've seen before. First facehugger - then chest-bursting (first Alien movie), then finding massively built Alien architecture on the station (like on planet LV426 in Aliens) - and you also get more or less the same guns like in Aliens from 1986. Of course you get another elevator ride like in Aliens too. Romulus feels like a dumb rushed copycat filled with bad acting and a story you only may find logical and plausible after drinking a bottle of wine or two, lol.My rating 3/10 - close to the worst movie in the franchise - but could so easily have been one of the best, sadly.",2024-08-26
1174,thomasgeoffroyodk,Fun but ridiculous in terms of cinema value,3,"Don't be fooled by the 1's: this is a fun movie to watch. It's a rollercoaster ride. The acting, the effects, the script. Its all 'ok'.But in the light of the original Alien from 1979, this movie is trash. It has none of the subtlety and depth of Alien's camera work (photographic composition), long shots (when cutting every 5 seconds wasn't a thing yet), the tense atmosphere, Jerry Goldsmith's slow yet vibrant score, the team vs a single tough monster feel, the aging actors with personality, etc.This movie is fun, but a complete joke when directly compared to the cinematic experience of the original Alien and that is all I can really think of and feel right now.I ask myself: why would anyone want to make a movie like this? Shouldn't we try to aim for the stars? Shouldn't we try to make a movie that looks at the original art of Giger and realise: 'Holy shit, the guy managed to create a universe with just a dozen paintings. And here we are squandering millions of dollars for this ADHD, 1000 cut travesty that is Alien: Romulus.'",2024-08-20

As others have previously said, the characters are so shallow and inauthentic. I can honesly say that this is the worst ""ALIEN"" movie in the franchise. So expensive too at £19.99 on Amazon Prime!I really wated to find something good to say but I can't. The sound was adequate, the score was insipid and the CGI was purely ambulatory, The Marketing was incredibly good for the movie....

1176,bccpldt,Least of the Alien movies,5,"Alien Romulus does a lot of things right such as the tone, the sets and some of the action scenes. It delivered on elements you'd expect in an Alien film. And there were good performances by the two leads.However, there was also a lot that had me frowning while I watched it.First, I didn't really like any of the characters outside the two leads. It's hard for me to be scared in a movie if I don't care if a character gets killed. Also, the fact that they resembled a group of college drinking buddies didn't work for me.Second, if you're a fan of the franchise then you'll find aspects of the plot lacking. Mainly that this is no more than a group of unsuspecting people stuck in a setting with some xenomorphs trying to kill them. How many times have we been there?Third, I haven't noticed anyone else complaining about this but the whole movie was too dark. Other technology on the ship and space station were working but not the lights?Fourth, using lines from previous movies can be awkward when the lines don't really fit the new scenes.Finally, from time to time there were things that just didn't make sense to me. Random questions would appear in my head like: ""How is no one else taking an interest in this space station?"" or ""how is she surviving in this area that is now part of the vacuum of space?"" or ""how did that thing get so big in 5 minutes?""In short, this movie basically retreads familiar territory, just in the dark with unlikable characters doing implausible things.

But since I'm an Alien fan, I like the story the movie tells, but I don't like the way it tells the story at all. I think there needs to be a balance between purely popcorn movies and cult alien movies like the alien film Prometheus, which of course, in recent films, alien movies haven't had that kind of narrative.

I literally rolled my eyes at the end when (it) reappeared one last time.Overall, poor action, characters and appalling dialogue. The only real threat was supplied by the loudness of the IMAX sound. I found the final act clunky and emotionless. Bring back the newborn from alien resurrection. I felt sorry for him. The abomination in this film had no character, no visible emotions and I think I must have said out loud, because I was thinking it, what the hell is that supposed to be?I have been looking forward to this film for a very long time and I'm afraid to say, I wish I hadn't bothered to see it.

However, the characters weren't established, no background or connection at all. What came in the second half was overly sporadic storylines with no real connection to anything. They spent more time focusing on weird goofy character moments that made no sense and added nothing to the storyline or main points. They spent more time focusing on those moments, rather than focusing on the Xenomorph and the magic of what the Alien franchise is. Many points of the movie made me want to laugh out loud due to its ridiculous storylines. So predictable, underdeveloped characters, horrible ending that made me just want to walk out.

But my god did it fall off a cliff of mindless cheesy action and way too many callbacks to the originals. Make something original yourself! It's lazy and not impressive. Andy the android was the best thing about the movie and the main lead was good too. The rip offs of the original movie was way too much for me. The last act was unnecessary and I felt it dragged on. Watch this movie on a Sunday on tv if you're bored. What a wasted opportunity after such a promising start.",2024-08-24
1182,seanon-06525,Don't believe the hype,5,"People are kinda saying that this is 3rd best in the series. That is definitely true but it's not much of a compliment given the other dross like AVP and Resurrection. Anything with a pulse would come 3rd. Does that mean it's bad - no, but it is not good either. It's a lesson in film making of trying to mix the first and the second films to appease fans and see if you get something good out of it instead of being original. What you end up with is the frustrating and unsatisfying feeling what could have been. Plus points - cast is good, decent acting, set design excellent, non-CGI effects (see negatives), very good. Downsides, let's start with the worst- CGI character. Absolutely terrible, completely ruins suspension of belief and destroys film. If it has been a 5 min cameo, might have just let it go but when it becomes a main character, it just ruins everything. WHAT were they thinking? Well, I think I know which leads us to the second major problem - fan service. Trust me I could not be more of a fan of Alien but the amount of Easter eggs is farcical. Again, if in the background and the odd one, maybe, but when they are forced down your throat (no pun intended) it again just repeatedly breaks the suspension of belief. It's annoying and so unnecessary and the worst has to be the repeated dialogue. This adds what exactly? Please, just stop. Third downside and this is related to points 1 and 2 : no suspense. In the first 15 mins aboard the ship I had high hopes but soon after it was soulless. You could predict every single jump scare and every plot point. Utterly predictable. If you rewatch Alien, it is masterclass in film making and suspense. Claustrophobic, totally immersive and SLOW to build the tension to unbearable levels. Remember the Alien itself was slow and deliberate - a brilliant idea. At one point in Romulus, I looked at my watch to see how much longer there was. To be fair there are 2 excellent scenes - the floating acid being the best. But just when you were feeling unsatisfied we have the 4th act. Before I went to see it, people were saying its insane - I down;t realise they were being literal as in stupid. Resurrection was bad enough but this for some unfathomable reason, the director not only wanted to redo it but see if he could do it worse - hats off he achieved it. Sadly, there will be a sequel given the box office take. I always like to think of films in three categories - see I tin the cinema, stream it or avoid. This is stream it. SO wanted this to be good, has some merits, but I wish they would just let it die now.",2024-08-28

When I saw the first trailer for Romulus, I was really excited but like most times these days, I was disappointed. The movie starts out strong with a unique premise but as it gets going, you start to not care about any of the characters. The action is just okay with nothing all that original except for the hundreds of face huggers scene that was really intense. As the story progresses, it gets more and more predictable and then there is the ending...what can I say about the ending other than it was horrible! I don't want to give too much away but it shares a similar ending to probably the worst movie in the series. If it went in another direction, maybe even a safer one, the movie would be up there with the original cut of the third one. Walking out of the theater, the ending left such a horrible taste in my mouth that I kept asking myself ""what was the director thinking."" I'm sure he was trying to be edgy or original, but it totally ruined the film.",2024-08-24

But it is really the single redeeming quality. Everything else just feels like a big mash up of all the memorable elemets from other movies, alien: isolation game and even a tabletop Alien RPG. Most of the characters seem out of place, they do not seem neither experienced nor rugged enough for space exploration or hard colony life. Andy is the only believeble one that goes through charcter development and is entertaining to watch.But after the first act everything from plot to dialogues are either just straight repeating or some sort of recycling. Android/human conflict copied from Aliens, all the memorable character phrases copied from Alien and Aliens, questionable Rook android CGI - throwback to Alien movie, weapon ammo counting and training scene - copied from Aliens and many more.

However, if you're line me and a bit longer in the tooth, it never really gets going. The story feels like it's been done, like a greatest hits album performed by a new line up.The cast is not great, with the female lead being the exception ( her name escapes me but she was good, certainly a young Ripley), but some of the others, ooh, tough watch.

First, I guess I'd have to say that I trully believe Ridley Scott never understood what he created with the first Alien movie. (Cameron and Fincher, yes Fincher, did) I really disliked Prometheus and the Covenant films. All that religious nonsense, all those terrible characters, all that bad writting...and for what? To kill what makes Alien so great in the first place: Its origins are unknown, there's no answer, it just exists and doesn't care for morals or emotions, just a destructive force from the darkness of the cosmos and we humans came across this nightmare. But no, you had to make a series of movies explaining every damn thing, not expanding this universe but making it smaller and smaller.This movie is just a continuation of this thread of bad prequels, with endless re-hashings of the first three films (paradoxically) but nothing deeper than that.Alvarez clearly is just a pawn here, a mere product maker for the studio and producers. There's nothing original, a film made for the ""fans"", wasting a vast potential of going deeper into the myth. I really wish for Scott to get tired of the Alien universe and steps back, leaving this story for someone who understands what makes it so special.

The British slang and accents were also very noticeable and sometimes felt a bit forced.If you're a teenager, you might not notice the cringiness because it feels familiar, but for anyone over 30, the constant drama and talking points just seem dumb and out of place.

The characters didn't have much character.The best character in the turned out to be Andy.Being a new age action movie, a lot of carnage took place. Face-huggers are a common enemy and you see them quite a lot once things take off. Its sad because the face huggers brought so much suspense and mystery to the old movies, and now they're used as some standard every day enemy. Its almost like a bad video game made into a movie that's decent.The film does drag on a bit.Ultimately I don't dislike it, but as others have said....... it really is a fan service movie made up of all other Alien movies.Its very lazy in my opinion. It doesn't do the franchise any justice.Also compared to ALL of the other Alien movies, the story quality is very low. It almost seems like it was written by AI with no heart or feelings behind it.Compared to the rest of the movies, I can't give this a high rating in good faith.

The attempt at character development is so weak that it might have been more effective to just show a blank screen with no sound for ten minutes. Furthermore, one crucial detail that could have added some authenticity to the characters was glaringly absent: where are their emotional support animals?

The original aliens had a throbbing tension, here the story was a coincidental sorry state of a story that really didn't know what was interesting in itself to begin with. Great on world filming. Characters though were terribly weak and if the end relied on cheesy vampire lore then the beginning relied on the cheesy teen Ghostbusters meets teenage star wars. Really a cash grab attempt at getting the younger audience while disappointing us old fans with a particularly futile attempt at film.

Modern writers seem unable to write characters and dialogue that make you care about the characters. Are they still on strike? It feels like AI has already replaced them given how vacuous and robotic their creations are. I wouldn't have been surprised had they all been androids as I wasn't bothered whether anyone lived or not. On the plus side it looks great which is the only reason for the 4 and not an even lower score.,2024-12-01
1202,alextrusk_,The Hybrid's Rapid Growth in Just Two Minutes is a Critical Flaw That Undermines the Believability of Its Transformation into a Towering Three-Meter Monster,5,"Well, the movie has its good parts, and the quality is impressive. The xenomorphs are made flawlessly, and the special effects are spot on. The stunning space views look fantastic.What I didn't like was the fact that the narrative confines itself primarily to the Weyland-Yutani research station. While the film presents an intriguing premise, it would have been far more engaging had the action extended beyond this limited setting and continued on the journey to the planet Yvaga.This shift could have facilitated richer plot development and allowed for a more gradual evolution of the human-xenomorph hybrid. As it stands, the film condenses the hybrid's growth into a mere two minutes, which detracts from the believability of its transformation into a towering three-meter monster. Such rapid development undermines the tension and suspense that could have been achieved with a more drawn-out timeline. By allowing the hybrid ample time to mature, the filmmakers could have created a more immersive experience, enhancing the overall impact of the story.To summarize: The special effects and cinematography are of the highest caliber, with no complaints in that regard. Overall, the film is quite well made, however, audiences typically expect a serious and mature narrative from science fiction. Unfortunately, the actors' portrayals looking and behaving like teenagers, fail to evoke that sense of depth after viewing, despite their overall decent performances. The plot is overly simplistic and condensed, which does not serve as a strong point for the film.",2024-10-20

Three laugh out loud but not when you are supposed to moments. The audience collectively groaned at one point. The characters are really uninspiring. Without spoiling it, it also falls for the same devaluation of the actual Alien idea by making them stupid and innefectual when it matters most and overcomplicating everything with the whole evolution inspired genetic engineering guff.

From that moment on, it became more about making money instead of a quality product - you know, like Friday the 13th or Halloween?Anyway, it's basically a movie about how neither time nor distance changes the stupidity or self-centeredness of humans. I found the movie to be 100% predictable. Nothing new or unexpected. Well, ok, the primary reason for the kids being where they are was different than the others.

The bulk of all three films is a straightforward repeat of previous used plot lines, much more than story-line continuity requires. Romulus even recycles a villain from an earlier episode in the franchise.I would compare this sequel to Prometheus (in the Alien franchise), or to Exorcist 3. Both these superior sequels maintain plot continuity while breaking new ground in fascinating and entertaining ways. No Omen sequel has accomplished that yet. This sequel in the Alien franchise does nothing, no memorable new devices, no characters I want to see again, no unique jump scares. Its script writing with a Xerox machine.",2024-12-04

(Like a Friday 13th kind of feel)Could have used some interesting and seasoned space workers, or similar. I wish that they had gotten some real good characters and used that to their advantage - like in the very first Alien gem.The end result is - where do they go now with the next one?

For me the best ones are Alien 1 and Prometheus. Real classics, but Romulus is nothing compared to them.

1210,douglas-gustafsson,could have been so good...,5,"Alien Romulus is a visual feast that truly sets the standard for the science fiction genre with its stunning cinematography and atmospheric environments. From the instantaneous images of the dizzying, alien landscape to the subtle details of the characters' costumes, each frame is a work of art in itself. The photo not only captures the terrifying beauty of the unknown, but also deepens the viewer's involvement in the story.The sound design is equally impressive. From the subtle hum of space station machinery to the dramatic, atmospheric sounds of extraterrestrial creatures, the soundscape creates a deeply immersive experience. The effects, both visual and audio, add a sense of realism and intensity that makes you feel part of the terrifying world.Unfortunately, the script falls flat in comparison to the fantastic production.In conclusion, ""Alien Romulus"" is a technical achievement that should be seen for its visual and audio brilliance, but it fails to deliver a story as memorable as its visuals. A film that is in many ways a feast for the eyes, but unfortunately it leaves a feeling that something important is missing from the script.",2024-11-17

It had no great memorable characters - I dare you to name 1 character. Had zero tension and just felt very meh with the same regurgitated scenes we've all seen previously.

The plot is passable, the CGI is great, some nice ideas dealing with the environment (gravity etc.), good action scenes. But where are the actor talent? Certainly not those just out of the daycare guys of unavoidably varying origins? Come on! The first Alien had brilliant actors, great dialogue, an insight in human psycology.

1213,gothbarbie84,What starts out promising ends up disappointing,5,"I was hopeful when I started watching this movie. I stayed away from reviews and spoilers. We even considered going to the cinema to watch this one, but I am glad we didn't waste our money.I'm a huge fan of the original two movies and I've seen and purchased editions of them more times than I care to remember. From vhs, dvd, Blu-ray, directors cut, etc. So maybe when I heard of another movie taking place in about the some period as the first two movies set unreasonable expectations.I didn't particularly love Prometheus and the other recent movies, but I can't refute that they are well made movies with thought and passion behind them. I just didn't agree with the way the story went and I felt that the mystery was better left unexplained.This movie has a deeper problem. It doesn't introduce anything new and adds absolutely zero depth to the universe it tries to portrey. It repeats - poorly - what was done better in the originals. But what is worse is that there are no likable characters. Annoying teens make this feel like any horror flic, except they aren't good looking and there is no sex and nudity.The alien's life cycle is so sped up that it takes away all its gravitas. Like if the movie itself doesn't have the patience to be watched. In the first movie one face hugger was scary. Here they can just be thrown away. There's no horror, little thrill. And no likable characters for whom you fear for their life.I don't know who made this movie but they did not deserve the job. Feels like yet another diversity project with zero passion. Just a paycheck for everyone involved.The black guy playing the android is a good actor though. I hope to see him again in a movie with better writing. Which is probably expecting too much.

Nothing makes sense and they don't try to hide it's lazy writing. Unlike the first film Alien, this film doesn't borrow heavily from it, no they stole it. They couldn't do what the original did. You couldn't care about any of them on Romulus. It gets to a point that even the lead actress is deserving of a good kill. The brother carried the movie. Alvarez didn't have one original idea. How is the object in question just hovering above them and some kids just happen to be conveniently the only ones aware of it. Praising this film is like giving praise to the crypto thief Sam Freid. Alvarez cherry picked from the past films while making up new rules regarding the creatures to pad this terrible script. When are we as consumers going to stop awarding and pandering to mediocrity in film. We deserve better and this film is in no way better.

People who have no 'dog in the fight' will see the movie for what it is... something that doesn't dare try anything new and does only what it needs to do to constitute its being an Aliens film. In other words: it's a completely forgettable film. That said, you can do what my girlfriend and I did to make it more enjoyable. We played a game of 'guess the order the characters will die in', and we were completely correct. We were also not surprised at all at being correct, and furthermore also correctly guessed the characters who were going to live. Please note: my girlfriend and I are not film geniuses or anything. So the characters had no substance or unique qualities, and the storyline was basically just common elements of other stories in this genre, and the dialogue seemed to be the bare minimum of what they needed to tell their boring story. The special effects were believable and good enough, so that was about the only thing that was good (not terrible) about the movie. However, if there's nothing else to watch, it'll do.

1217,Reticent_Reviewer,"Yep, I'm getting old",4,"It's interesting to note how many modern movies, especially in the sci-fi and action genres, are heavily populated by teens or characters in their early twenties. While there's no denying the appeal of youth and the freshness it brings to the screen, it does raise some questions about the believability of these characters' roles. For instance, would someone so young really have accumulated the experience and knowledge required to run a spaceship or make complex strategic decisions? It often feels like these characters are thrust into positions that, realistically, would require years of training and life experience to handle effectively.This trend toward younger casts could be driven by a desire to attract a younger audience, as studios may believe that younger viewers are more likely to engage with characters who are close to their own age. There's also a certain escapism involved; perhaps it's easier to imagine oneself as a hero if that hero is young and unburdened by the responsibilities that come with age. However, this narrow age demographic can sometimes feel limiting, especially for viewers who long to see more seasoned, mature characters who bring a different perspective to the narrative.I find myself yearning for the days when movies featured a more diverse range of ages. Take, for example, the original Alien and Aliens films. These movies are iconic not just because of their intense plots and groundbreaking special effects, but also because of the depth and complexity of their characters, who were mostly adults with a level of experience that added to the realism and tension. The character of Ripley, portrayed by Sigourney Weaver, is a perfect example-a strong, capable adult who faces unimaginable horrors with grit and intelligence. The presence of such characters brings a level of gravitas and credibility that can sometimes be missing in more youth-centric films.Ultimately, while there's nothing inherently wrong with younger protagonists, there's a balance that seems to be missing in many modern films. A greater mix of ages among the main characters could not only enhance the storytelling but also broaden the appeal of these movies to a wider audience. Unfortunately, it seems that ship has sailed for many recent films, but there's always hope that future movies will bring back the depth and diversity that made classics like Alien and Aliens so unforgettable.BRING BACK ADULTS!",2024-08-26

The first two are obviously the pinnace, followed by a series of missteps. I had hoped that the new film would breathe new life into the series, but no, it's the same old garbage. Here we have a series of faceless characters introduced and the viewer immediately starts figuring out who will die, in what order and who will survive. There are NO surprises here, no new ground covered, it's the same old, same old. A movie filled with people you don't care about, reciting clever lines from older films. The recreation of pivotal scenes from previous movies was beyond cringe-worthy, a cheap trick that didn't come close to working any of the times they did it. The biggest failure was filling the movie with characters you simply don't care about. Plus,it was BORING. My wife fell asleep around 40 minutes in and nothing woke her up, not the explosions, not the screams, not the soundtrack, doors closing, doors opening, nothing. Of all the movies in this franchise, this might be the only one that I sincerely hope to never see again. Why watch it again?

1223,elliotgear,Directors must be banned from trying to hit the nostalgia nerve,5,"This long awaited movie starts off well enough, the main actress is likeable and the ""synthetic"" is too, although some of the others seem pretty dumb and it's hard to care about them.It seems promising for the first half an hour or so but then when the CGI version of Ian Holmes arrives it goes downhill from there. The CGI is so bad that it looks as though a child made it on their home PC..... if you can't do it well then you shouldn't attempt it at all, let Ian Holmes rest in peace rather than making him turn in his grave.But what is most infuriating is this idea that some directors have, that quoted famous lines from the original movies are somehow going to make the movie better by bringing some kind of nostalgic feeling out of you.....they do not.Perhaps if a couple of quotes were used once or twice in a subtle way, but repeatedly doing this just makes it appear as though the director is unable to make a decent movie himself and has to rely on quoting the originals to ""hit that nostalgia spot"".Furthermore in a movie that should have a dark and ominous feel to it, it just comes across as cheap and tacky. At one point after several cringeworthy quotes it reached a part where the synthetic person ""Andy"" kills an Alien and proceeded to say ""Get away from her ... *pause*"" .....
I sat up and screamed ""dont you dare......dont you dare say it!!!!""
Andy ..... ""you ""..... I have never cringed so hard in my life.If you are under the age of 25 or 30 and were not brought up loving the originals or know them well then there's a chance you may like the movie, as it isnt too bad if it wasnt for this glaring problem.However if youre from an older generation like myself and loved the originals, you will probably find yourself cringing as much as I did.",2024-09-21

1227,davidmvining,Meh,5,"I've only previously seen one of Fede Alvarez's films, Don't Breathe, and I didn't like it. He had the ability to mount tension, but I just found the overall experience kind of gross and never felt a need to go back for more. Well, when he was announced as having control of the Alien franchise, I wasn't terribly excited. The trailers ended up looking slick and fun, though, so my excitement actually grew. Reviews were overall positive, though people I listen to were much more muted, and then the lights went down.I will say this for Alvarez, he's a quality director. He's kind of a terrible writer, but he brings style and a wonderful physical sense to the action set in the Alien universe. Starting on the mining colony Jackson's Star, we see this grimy world with no sun and no hope in which we find Rain (Cailee Spaeny) and her brother/dedicated android Andy (David Jonsson) hoping to have met her quota from the Weyland-Yutani Corporation to earn her way off the rock. She hopes to reach the independent system far from the Company's control, but when the Company deems her to be only halfway to her quota, she's stuck.Where this film begins to feel wrong is the speed that it brings its assortment of characters together and into space. There are a lot of unanswered questions about how her friend Tyler (Archie Renaux) owns a working ship that can reach orbit, how it can just go into space without any sort of clearance, and how everyone can seem to just be missing work. Most of it could have been settled with quick lines of dialogue that I'd bet are in the original script but got cut out of the final edit because they were deemed unnecessary. I'm not entirely disagreeing, but it does create this series of small logical loopholes in the opening that just kind of leave a bad taste in my mouth.Other than that, though, the opening is actually quite strong. The core of it, and what should have been the core of the film, is this relationship between Andy and Rain, Andy being kind of stupid and unable to take care of himself despite his directive from Rain's deceased father being to keep her safe. They have this symbiotic relationship that gets a decent amount of screentime with the ironic twist that Rain can't have Andy on the independent world because he's Company property (which...I'm not sure if it completely makes sense within the context of their relationship, but okay). Tyler and his little group, all of whom also want to escape Jackson's Star, have picked up a defunct Company vessel in orbit that has cryo-technology on it, the sort of technology that will make interstellar travel possible for the gang, and most of the gang is just straight up Alien bait and don't matter.The ship ends up being the space station Romulus (with a Romulus/Remus divide that doesn't make a whole lot of sense but seems to be designed narratively as a way to keep the characters from moving too quickly towards the film's final act), and it has been ravaged by...something terrible. Oh, you bought a ticket to an Alien movie? No surprise what's happening here!What Alvarez does well from this point on are individual sequences of horror, the best of them being how our characters are introduced to facehuggers with Tyler trying to get more cryo-fuel in a partially submerged room, facehuggers coming out of hibernation, and then springing and jumping and stuff. It's a tense, solidly built sequence that makes us feel like, especially after the more character-based opening, that we're going to be in some solid hands for this thrill ride.Except, Alvarez loses complete sight of the core dynamic for most of what happens, Andy taking on a separate personality with the uploading of an upgrade from another android, Rook (Daniel Betts), who shares a visage with a well-known villain from one of the previous films. Now, this has become, mostly obliquely since people don't want to get too much into spoilers, a lightning rod for how the film is all just call backs. There are a lot, and the call backs range from groan inducing to kind of interesting, and I think this decision leans more towards the latter. It tells the audience, from the moment we see this guy, that we can't trust him. Of course, the critique is heightened by the fact that it uses Deepfake tech and doesn't do it well, which is totally valid. Those lips are terrible.Anyway, it becomes a race to get through the space station to arrive at the other side where the ship they took up crashed with xenomorphs coming at them from every direction. It becomes a movie of sequences, and the sequences all become overlong, especially since none of the cannon fodder are interesting. It also doesn't help that the relationship between Andy and Rain ends up falling off to the side, only to pop up occasionally as important. There is one moment in the latter half, though, that felt like the beginnings of something really good. Andy, with his upgrade that has made him smarter and faster, has an oblique comment to Rain about how he was going to be left behind for her. It's meant accusatorially, and it hits, but it mostly just goes away by the end, Rain finding a way around Andy's hurt that's very computer-centric but easy emotionally.There's another fun sequence in the second half where Rain has to balance gravity, a gun, and swirling, floating acid-blood to get down a tunnel that's fun, but like most of these sequences, it ends up just continuing, and continuing and continuing. It's not varied enough. It's not emotional enough. It's not fun enough.And then there's the crazy final ten minutes or so that are really undermined by the fact that it all hinges on one cannon fodder character who has had absolutely no characterization, taking this pastiche of ideas from Prometheus and Alien: Resurrection and just not doing them well at all. I mean, the creature is creepy to look at, and that's probably the most that Alvarez really wanted from it.So, meh. I don't hate it. It's not good, though. Not even close. There are some interesting things that mostly get dropped. There are some decent sequences, but most aren't that great. It looks great from beginning to end, though, and there are some good performances with special mention to Jonsson who manages the changes in his character quite well. The callbacks aren't uniformly terrible (I groaned during the ""Get away from her"" moment, but I sat next to a woman who pretty much cheered at it), but it's kind of emblematic of how mixed this whole endeavor is. If Alvarez and his cowriter Rodo Sayagues had had a better grasp of how to actually build a story, it might have been more fun.Meh.",2024-08-30

The introduction of the DEI-focused android character felt forced and lacked the nuanced complexity that makes characters in the series memorable. Instead of adding depth, this character felt like a checkbox requirement.

If you pursue the ultimate weapon, and the ultimate weapon is an extremely violent (and disgusting) alien which can evolve and adapt so rapidly that there is basically no chance at all that you could ever control it, the best option is to get one or two sample aliens and perform highly dubious experiments on them through a series of breeding attempts, hoping you can convince some androids to help because aliens do not lay their eggs inside androids.There sure is a lot of messing around in space in Alien: Romulus. The story begins with people laboring hard on a mining colony, but they are not allowed to leave. It just so happens that these people also live in a spaceship, and before you know it, they leave. Then they dock on some space station that is really poorly positioned but that's just a plot crutch so no need to dwell on that. Then they get some pods and energy things but they also, and I do not think this is a spoiler at all, they wake up some of those really violent aliens who love to put (their) things in (your) mouths.Despite a runtime of 1:59, it sure felt every minute of well over two hours. Because the movie is so dark, you might find time for a snooze during those scenes without chest explosions.",2024-08-22
1230,matyax,Aliens themed Stranger Things,4,"If the movie had a different name, it would have been just another mediocre ""horror"" movie with kids as protagonists, but unfortunately they chose to try to make this part of the alien franchise.From the very beginning, the plot is bland, predictable, and full of cliches. The characters too, and the acting equally bad. Other reviews speak about fan service, but I personally didn't find anything, or at least not much.Not even the space theme was able to balance the lack of depth in the plot. No atmosphere at all, and no decent photography as well. Dark, shaky, and with orange/blue tint.This movie clearly wasn't for me, and if you're like me, this is a pass.",2024-10-27
1231,ilikeimdb,Completely derivative and rather predictable but well-executed special effects and action sequences,4,"I've seen every Alien movie in the franchise and trying to rank Alien: Romulus versus the others is tough because you have multiple categories such as script / plot, acting, special effects, sci-fi content, and editing. Script/Plot: The plot is incredibly derivative with lots of fan service...there's not an original concept in A:R...it steals unapologetically from the other franchise films. Script/plot: You have an absurd and nearly impossible setup with super immature people reacting like 8 year olds as though they were on the set of Prometheus (that's very annoying but at least this crew wasn't hired for a multi-billion space journey). The plot has huge, unbelievable holes. Acting: Cailee Spaeny has a future ahead of her and David Jonsson had a tough role, also believable. The other cast members were given to histrionics all too often. Special Effects: Top rate. Sci-fi content: Pretty nerdy visuals and lots of well-crafted display shots. Editing: Fairly snappy but the movie does drag at the beginning. // Overall, I found the plot of A:R so laughable in plausibility and so grossly lacking in original ideas (aka, sycophantic fan service) that I spent most of my time at Regal Edward's watching my Apple Watch warn me over and over about the nearly endlessly loud (90db+) volume level. In space you can't hear yourself scream because Regal Theaters made you deaf.",2024-08-19

Ever since I saw the original in my local cinema, a long time ago. Yeah, I know each subsequent film has pretty much followed the same formula since: spaceship, crew, exploration, exposure, beastie, blood/chaos/death, final show down between the critter and our heroine. Great stuff. But this was so dependent on the previous films: scenes, lines, plot twist all stolen from great scenes from earlier films. Very predictable, stand alone movie (think Solo: A Srar Wars Movie), with nothing new to offer. Real shame.",2024-08-26

It is uncomparable to the suspense of the original 'Alien' movie, when I had all my nails bitten off and had nightmares for weeks. Some scenes are just fast-forwarded without letting the viewer know how did the problem got solved. In my opinion the Aliens are not as terrifying as they use to be, a couple of screams and running scenes are all you gonna get. I really missed the feeling of hopelessness and that the 'perfect organism' is truly controls all outcomes, being super-intelligent.The movie misses originality, feels like a mixture of the mediocre scenes of part 1, 2 and 4.Although the universe this movie set in is an essential addition and gives more depth of the era it is displaying.",2024-08-19

1235,kakuraka,It was terrible banal,5,"It was terribly banal. It felt like the movie was made for stupid tourists. They explain everything and everywhere. Every step. So that the viewer, God forbid, does not confuse what exactly happened on the screen, what was done and what the characters' plans are. Even all the previous films in the franchise began to look stronger against the background of this last film. Because they had individuality and atmosphere. And the viewer was not taken for a fool. And the characters did not voice every step, explaining banal things to the viewers from frame to frame. In the previous films, a lot of emphasis was on telling the story of the ""alien"" himself. He was not a simple addition. He was one of the main antagonists. You felt his mind and the reasons for what was happening. In the old films, a lot was left behind the scenes so that the viewer ""thought out his own fears"" and was afraid of the worst. In the current film, we just got a set of popular textures from the game and recognizable sketches from the Alien universe. A hodgepodge of everything we saw in other films of the franchise, games and memes. All this is even from different time periods. With a difference of hundreds of years. The film has absolutely no individuality. Solid repetitions. If you replace the alien with a character from the movie ""The Thing"" or with ghosts from ""Ghostbusters"", nothing will change. Even the trailer looked more atmospheric and you could feel the intensity of passions. Absolute complete nonsense about the accelerated growth of the alien. Well, everyone writes about this anyway. The graphics are disgusting in places. The robot at the station is just some kind of parody. I am very disappointed. ... No one will hear you scream.",2024-08-18

If you are in the younger generation and don't know about 70's,80's and 90's movies you myth get a small trill. I really believe Hollywood is dead. Other countries in the world have way better content and actor. This a movie you put out straight on TV. Not theater worthy. I think I will stay home and watch old movies even if I seen them 100's of times I don't get bored that's what a good film does.",2024-08-26
1237,rutledgech,You could not write a spoiler. You've seen it all before.,4,"Went in to the cinema in a pro-Alien mood. Got irritated vey soon into it. The soundtrack is so overstuffed with -""space crescendo?""- noise that you strain to make out the dialogue. The visuals attempt to be gritty and industrial, but often are just badly lit, foggy, dim and brown. Artsy replica visuals of the first Alien just come off muddy.Then we get to the spacecrafts - and total confusion. The film cuts frantically back and forth between the craft used to dock to the massive resident evil ship so often, at multiple places, through so many space locks, it just gets confusing. As in where is this action happening. The escape pods, that critical go-to plot hinge, get moved so hither and yon that they become ""whatever - where did we last park them"" And there is no particular logic to what area of the host ship we are in, of going to, or escaping from. No, just endless space lock doors that the protagonists open and close, with no sense that they have a clue where The Thing is. Actually, our boy Romulus, the Alien, does not seem to have much more of a sense of direction either. The film totally fails to come up with any fresh embellishments of the evil corporation fooling around with the apex predator. No, just the same old Corporation with a ginormous space ship Up To No Good Experimentation with Predictably Disastrous Results. (Has Head Office ever inquired as to why their mega ships for evil experiments all get lost in space? ""Say, Fred, has our Experiment Ship submitted time sheets for the evil scientists lately?"")The Alien as a creature is all standard fare. I can't think of a single spoiler to fit into this review. You've seen every slobbering, slimy, metaphorical penetration, vaginal metaphor before. The Alien is boringly familiar - as in "" Bro, are you still swinging from conduit to conduit drooling in the dim recesses? Say, why not try the old trick of just hiding behind the massive air lock, and wait for them to open it""Overall, an unimaginative derivative film, with no clever or inventive twists added.",2024-08-18

I don't count the number of times I thought the acting is cringe and throw you out of the movie.

1240,danesjago,"Random syringe of mystery goo? Sure, I'll inject that.",5,"So picture this. I'm on this cargo ship that's gone to this decommissioned space station which turns out to be full of weird science experiments and this a creepy android that's been cut in half by acid from this monstrous looking alien creature.I'm nice and safe inside the ship still because I'm pregnant and I don't want to endanger and risk my unborn child's life, then out of nowhere this alien creature shows up in the ship! So I run and instead of closing a door behind me I keep running until I fall over a ledge I didn't see.I was eventually woken up by the few remaining crew, many had been killed by this alien creature. They had this black goo in a syringe that they had probably got from the weird, strange, experimental biolab that harboured all these weird alien creatures. I see no problem with this, it's just some mystery goo after all, who doesn't trust weird black goo?So eventually I'm in this elevator back to the ship and I get left alone and told to go because I'm pregnant and I shouldn't be taking any unnecessary risks on my fragile unborn child, I am pregnant after all and shouldn't be doing anything that could potentially harm myself or my baby.So they left me alone with this weird goo syringe which they told me nothing about, but obviously it came from this weird experimental, shady biolab and I figured, why shouldn't I inject myself with this? It's just weird goo from some crooked galactic megacorp who I'm trying to escape from because they are slowly killing me. What could possibly go wrong? If you can't trust mystery goo in this vast universe, what can you trust exactly?So two of my crewmates return and they put me in a cryosleep bed, I'm sure glad that weird, experimental mystery goo bought me that 5 minutes that I probably easily would have survived without.Anyway, all of a sudden I don't feel so good. My baby has grown exponentially and is ready to be born, but Oh no! It's a weird alien and It's very much going to kill me in child birth. Who? Who I ask, could possibly have guessed that this weird black goo from a corrupt, unethical, galaxy spanning corporation's experimental science lab, that was clearly making bioweapons, couldn't be trusted?! What has the galaxy come to?So here I am, dying from my horrible, tortuous, agonizing and traumatizing beyond belief alien hybrid child birth that I never could have predicted would be the result of injecting mystery goo and before I die I just want to say that this film had some really nice visuals.The dystopian, corporate landscape portrayed early in the film fit the 'Alien' aesthetic very well and was very believable. That trend continued with the look of the Romulus space stations exterior and interior. I particularly liked the planetary rings and the sequence of the station crashing into them. The set and art design, special effects and practical effects team all deserve solid praise.Also the Android, played by David Jonsson was outstanding and easily the highlight acting performance. He acted both 'roles' of the android well and I hope he achieves some recognition for his fantastic performance.David Jonsson's acting and the spectacular visuals are why I am giving this a five instead of a two. Far too much fan service, mostly uninteresting characters I had no investment in, which I should have. They had such a great template in the dystopian planet they created that painting believable characters I could sympathise with shouldn't have been hard. That and characters doing unbelievably stupid, unforgivable, cliche horror decisions time and time again.The Alien franchise deserves better.",2024-08-20
1241,belfastashby,Not for me personally,5,"Sooooo.... I wasn't a fan personally.I wouldn't be in a mad rush to watch it again like I do with the other movies, even Alien 3 & 4 I'd watch again first. Was it the worst sci fi horror I've seen? No, was it the best and especially for the Alien franchise? No. I can however see how it would appeal to people, especially the younger generation as well (talking like a 60 year old stuck inside a 30 year olds body haha). It was a slow burner, I don't mind that at times but then it felt a bit scattered and the ending personally wasn't for me. The acting was on point though, especially David Jonsson.I found the look of Xenomorph & face huggers were exceptional!If I was going to give it a rating, I'd maybe go a 5.5/10, going with a 5 on here as to go over 5, I usually want to have to watch it again to give it another try but I'm not getting that feeling with this one.-------------------",2024-08-16

But here a kid is killing an army of aliens with one gun, as you may guess as usual there is an undefeatable lady but at least in the old ones she was a bit less of a Rambo. Anyway we also have a stuttering android which is very kind and loving ( you guessed it so I will not say it) . I'm seriously concerned about Hollywood, they cannot come up with anything creative since 2010, my suggestion is to find out wherever the old script writers are and fire the current block heads.",2024-08-18
1243,p-mattias,Ruined by tiresome fan service.,5,"Alien: Romulus starts off well and there's no doubt that Fede Alvarez can create creepy atmosphere and has an eye for detail. Too bad then that the movie falls apart into a tiresome mishmash of all the previous Alien movies with a constant, enervating and crowd-pleasing fan service.Remember this character from Alien? Guess what, he's back! Isn't that cool? Remember his famous one-liner? Guess what, he's going to say it again!!! Isn't that cool? Remember the scene where Hicks teaches Ripley how to use a pulse rifle? We have similar scene in Romulus, isn't that cooooool? Remember the countdown to destruction in Alien? We have one of those too, isn't that cooooool? Remember Ripley's famous one-liner when she goes to save Newt? We have that one too!!! Isn't that coooooool? Remember, well that, that thing from Alien: Resurrection, we have that too. And that scene from Aliens, we're recreating it too!!! Aren't we cooooooooool with all this old junk we keep throwing at you?It's tiresome, so damn tiresome. Since the movie borrows so much from previous movies, the overall plot feels trite and very predictable. There's a lot to criticize in the previous Alien movies but at least they tried to take the franchise in a new direction or do something new that you haven't seen before. That's not the case with Romulus.It's a shame, because there are moments I liked. There were some memorable action sequences. I also liked the characters Rain and the android Andy. The practical effects and set design really shine and the xenomorphs are slimy and terrifying as they should be. It's just a shame that the rest of the movie doesn't live up to it and feels more like a fan movie from YouTube.I give Alien: Romulus 5.5 out of 10 facehuggers.",2024-08-20
1244,My_Favorite_Color_Is_Pizza,Meh...,5,"Let me start with the positives about Romulus.1. I appreciate the choice of models and analog special effects over CGI. It adds an element of believability (and respectability) that lacks in so many modern SciFi flicks.2. The supporting cast is solid and it's nice to see some fresh new faces who are good at their craft.3. The musical score is well done and in the style of the original Alien.Now let me whine and complain.1. The audio mixing for this film is terrible. The disparity between the dialogue volume and the music/sound effects is absurd. I missed 40% of the storyline simply because I couldn't hear what was being said. Next thing I know, my ear drums are being blown out by jump scare sound effects. It was unbelievably frustrating.2. The storyline is weak (very much so). Granted, I missed a lot of the story because I couldn't hear it thanks to the inaudible dialogue. Regardless, there was SO much opportunity to craft an amazing storyline that weaves in with the original and it simply fell flat.3. There is no real character development, especially with our main protagonist. We aren't given opportunity to identify with her, and by the end of the movie I was rooting for the Alien.In all, Romulus feels like a movie that was made simply to capitalize on the Alien series. I wouldn't say it's a bad film, but I think anyone thinking about seeing it on the big screen should either wait for $5 Tuesday tickets or hold-out to watch it online once it's available for streaming.",2024-08-21

Too much gross-out horror! Too much gratuitous sadism! Too damn much running around and screaming, to too little effect.When I say sadism, I'm talking about some of the characters' deaths, which have clearly been designed to be as excruciatingly cruel, grisly, and protracted as possible.What a comedown from the first two films in the series -- both classics, with memorably colorful characters.I'm also, no doubt, one of the many here who'll praise ""Romulus"" for its impressive production design. On that score, at least, it probably deserves some sort of award.But hardware and SFX aside, what a thoroughly unpleasant, confusing two hours this move was!

Lots of stuff from the 1979 set to spot.The monster scared the life out of me as it should.But then it has to stand on its merits. Script is awful.

1250,i_the_exploder-93-284236,Let it die..,5,"As a long-time fan of the first, second and even third Alien films. I was initially excited to see what Alien Romulus had to offer. The film starts strong, introducing intriguing characters and building suspense reminiscent of the earlier entries in the series. However, that initial promise quickly fades and retreads old ground that ultimately ruins the experience. The film borrows from Alien: Isolation a number of times and I can't help but feel that would have made a better movie than this.The film's first act does a decent job of setting the stage with its atmospheric tension. Unfortunately, as the narrative progresses, it becomes painfully clear that the film is merely recycling old plots and themes that have been explored ad nauseam in previous installments. Even at one point using a rather forced quote of ""Get away from her, you b*tch!"" that just feels shoehorned in. Instead of forging new ground, it seems to rely heavily on nostalgia (like most films nowadays) although to it's credit it does a good job of utilising the old retro-style 'modern' technology from the originals.The final act is where Alien Romulus truly falls apart. Just when it seemed like there might be a chance to finish on a high, it veers into a territory that feels like a poor homage to Alien Resurrection and shoe horning Prometheus plot points into it. The decision to resurrect an idea that didn't quite work more than two decades ago which then feels both lazy and uninspired. I was itching for the film to end by this point.The performances were solid (especially David Jonsson's Andy) but it's disheartening to witness the franchise stumble when it had the potential for a compelling new chapter. Overall, Alien Romulus is a rather mediocre and slightly disappointing addition that starts well but ultimately fails to recapture the magic of its predecessors.",2024-08-27

I was hoping to follow the same story line, but unfortunately they decided to produce a remake to Aliens, only without a little girl.It was too hollow and empty as script, I can't say I was surprised or excited with anything in particular.Nothing unseen before, absolutely nothing. It kind of looked like a fan-made movie, full of nonsense scenes and bad CGI.Don't get me wrong - I'm not saying it was a bad movie, it just failed to impress me.I'll put it this way - I can rewatch ""Prometheus"" and ""Covenant"", as well as the old movies, every weekend, and I won't get bored.

If that's what your hoping to watch like me it's not what your going get. So just take snippets of alien and aliens and maybe bits of the other two add some new characters and a slightly new story line and hey presto - here's alien Romulus.Although the ending held the same shock factor like earlier films which was good, it left me feeling like I wouldn't be so eager to go and watch it at the cinema when it's released.

Not very good, though, but actually better.The strongest point of the film lies in the visuals. It recaptures the retrofuturistic machinery and environments that allow the artistic department to really shine.I respect the simple premise, but the character writing is probably the weakest aspect of the film. You almost feel like you could predict every dialogue based on the most stereotypical archetypes in the horror movie genre. However, it remains solid until the third act, when they completely lost any sense of direction, at least for my taste.Also, there seem to be a lot of references and tributes to prior films, which I don't hate, but they scream: ""We do not have anything new to offer, keep loving us for what we were"" over and over again.",2024-08-30

The action sequences are pretty good, and as usual the Xenomorphs are badass and calculated with their tactics and approach but when you are a fan of something like Alien and Ripley for the perspective of a brilliantly intelligent and badass female character you tend to want to see that continued in a franchise. Unfortunately, none of the human characters in this movie were even remotely likeable to me. They all held deeply regrettable flaws and were selfish, egotistical and ignorant which made them really hard to root for - and that includes the final girl Rain Carridine.The saving grace is Andy, who happens to be an AI which may be a bit of a spoiler but nevertheless the perspectives his character brings and the moral dilemmas he makes you think upon in consideration to the human characters is crucial to the storyline.One aspect of things is a bit predictable, but I will keep that vague on purpose and say that hybridism is a strong theme here for sure.All in all, a mixed bag because it was well-written, well-filmed, and had some good actors who I really like such as Archie Renaux but the final girl lacked substance, was too weak, and was manipulative and borderline foul as a person.",2024-08-19

While being a horror fan, maybe this particular vein isn't quite for me because I know a lot of people really enjoyed this film. I was going into it expecting a solid horror/sci-fi, when in actuality, I feel like I got a decently mediocre action movie.The plot was sparing and mainly prevalent at the beginning, lightly setting the stage as a vehicle for the action to come... but the storytelling fell off pretty quickly after that. It felt pretty repetitive throughout with the constant cat and mouse game being played. While I know this is the nature of the beast it still wore a bit thin for me.While the third act was actually my favorite, by the time we got there, I found myself saying ""we're doing this again??"".If you go into this expecting a Hollywood action movie full of jump scares and impressive effects... you will most certainly be pleased.

The opening premise - where a group of twenty-somethings who have never seen the sun and desperately want to leave one of Weyland Yutani's hellhole colonies - is also strong and highly relatable to a younger, more rebellious audience. However, if you wanted to see the Alien universe expand and evolve into something new, you're going to be left somewhere between disappointed and unsurprised as Alien: Romulus relies again on the now standard formula of dark corridors, teeth, blood, acid and goo. In fact, there are SO MANY references to the first three films (props, sets, lighting, characters, costumes, music, sound effects, camera angles and even lines of the script) it's more like going to see a tribute act of your favourite band, rather than watching a film. The performances are all fine, particularly David Jonsson as Andy, but Bjorn didn't even scream as his fingers were being dissolved right in front of him, and like so many other Alien sequels the sterile, scientific logic of the original has been ignored leaving some obvious plot holes: The Nostromo was reduced to atoms in three detonations, but wreckage somehow survived? And the retrieved Alien just happened to be floating nearby? If only a queen can lay eggs, where did all the facehuggers come from? There is also no way Weyland Yutani would have simply left the Romulus station unguarded and open to this kind of breach in security. All in all a good sci-fi/horror romp which does a great job of introducing the Alien universe to a younger generation - but the praise being heaped on this film seems to be coming only from die-hard fans of the franchise who literally just want to see the same thing again and again and again.",2024-09-26

The storyline, the characters, the performances - everything nearly perfect. But in the dozens of times I've seen it since, the story just didn't hit as hard - which is to be expected. That's the feeling I got watching Romulus - I've seen this story before and the familiarity while pleasant, isn't doing it for me. Having said that the production and the performances are pretty good. If you're going because you're a fan, you'll enjoy it.

The production design is immaculate and the creature design creepy and pretty imaginative.I´ve never seen David Jonsson before but he does a great job as a conflicted android,being passed the torch from Michael Fassbender and Ian Holm. Speaking of Ian Holm...well,the intention and idea regarding his involvement is commendable,the execution put into practice is thoroughly misguided and jarring.The Alien movies have always thrived on their supporting ensembles. More than just being canon fodder or ""Xeno-chow"",the franchise has produced alot of colorful and intriguing characters portrayed by what time has deemed to be cult actors. These kids here (Was there a need for the narrative to make them kids?) have zero personality,are all interchangeable and portrayed without any real passion except for Cailee Spaeney who does another pretty good job as a young,sweaty and distraught chick trying to survive.But this is bland,streamlined and calculated moviemaking with very obvious easter eggs and although the screen is filled eith new blood,Aliens is running suffocatingly low on new ideas. The movie has a pretty creative ending but at that point,you might have checked out your lizard brain an hour ago.To this franchise,it seems that real thrills,real character development and attempts to create something truly innovative has become depressingly....alien?

The filmography, lighting, sound, and pace of the movie was great. On the other side, for anyone that doesn't know the Alien saga, you will be totally lost, and you won't have a clue on what is going on. The cast is totally forgettable. I really didn't care much about any of them (except the robot). The cast needed a senior (and older) member to provide a level of believability. Overall, the story was weak. After viewing, you can see that the writers wanted to get to specific point for the Alien franchise,

1261,AnActorExplains,A better knockoff than most.,5,"Gorgeous in cinematography, Alien Romulus replicates its predecessors to the point of bastardizing quotes and legacy moments from prior Alien installments. The premise here is an identical facsimile of past Alien movies, just without the character development, industry setting pace, or other vital details which defined the original as groundbreaking or the sequel as thrilling. Fede Álvarez plays it very safe here, a directive he most probably received from the film's producers and corporate executives (who spinelessly refuse to greenlight anything original for fear of failure, only for their pathetic reproductions to flop twice as often).The script here is procedural instead of relatable, articulating the future actions of the crew instead of delving into character thru conflict. Alien development becomes absurd in this film, interfering with viewer suspension of disbelief. Lacking in cast interaction, missing interesting subplots and void of any subtlety whatsoever, ""Alien Romulus"" devolves into a semi-enjoyable popcorn flick that lacks any meaning or nuance. For many of us, this is a major disappointment. On the other hand, Romulus has been quickly embraced by the majority, earning more than four times its budget at the box office.",2024-10-18

Feels abit the spotlight is more about the characters than the alien.They have put so much effort in the twist and plots but still shallow but doing a good job. Missing the main storyline as ofcourse we know what they want to achieve but it feels like yeah we all know their goal but they do not feed it, like why there. I lik the political message the reason for leaving and situation.The ending is kinda dissapointing as it is so classic.Do love their camera work and screen quality is like the 90's and they push through the whole movie the vibe and elements what is lovely but especially in the intro it is hard to watch as it is low quality

From the moment the film begins, you're transported to a vividly imagined universe that feels both expansive and intimate. The stunning visuals and groundbreaking special effects create a mesmerizing backdrop, but it's the story that truly captivates.The plot masterfully weaves themes of survival, identity, and connection, exploring what it means to be alien in a universe that often feels unwelcoming. The characters are brilliantly developed, with performances that resonate on an emotional level. You find yourself deeply invested in their journeys, each moment of tension and triumph echoing long after the credits roll.The film's pacing is impeccable, balancing action-packed sequences with quieter, introspective moments that allow the audience to reflect on the deeper implications of the narrative.

And in the first hour or so I thought I was watching a serious ALIEN film for a while.But the plot holes mount up and mount up and eventually you just have to park your tongue in your cheek and buckle up and enjoy the silly but well executed action scenes.The plot goes out the airlock.Gotta say the stand out performance was from the actor who played the android.The CGI uncanny actor, however, was unforgivable (you'll know it when you see it).But - it wasn't COMPLETELY terrible. It wasn't boring and depressing and off-script like Alien 3. It wasn't just stupid and dumb like Alien 4.It wasn't stupid dumb and BORING like Prometheus or that other tripe fest.(I hear somebody wanted to make films involving the Predator, but we haven't heard anything yet ..... yet .....)The build up and tension is there at the beginning, and enough of a story to keep you watching. Then it starts to go silly, and just becomes an action fest. If you just let it carry you along, it's Ok.I can't spoil the ending but it's too long and very silly, but still I left saying ""Wow, that wasn't completely terrible!""There is now a 3rd ... well, 2 and a half ...

I don't want to write spoilers, maybe other folks want to watch this absolute average sci-fi horror.Okay, the lots of built sets and many-many practical effect gave a fresh breeze in this CGI dominated industry, but the lack of originality is killed the freshness.

It starts out quite boring with bland, uninteresting characters who were able to do things that they shouldn't be able to do way too easily. Then, it devolves into an attempt at a horror movie rather than a science fiction film. Finally, it wraps up in one of the most ludicrous, hilarious ways possible. If you've seen the movie, you know what I'm talking about. It's not good when a movie that's trying to thrill you makes you chuckle out of amusement because of how stupid it is.

Alien Romulus is a hodgepodge of references and callbacks to Alien, Aliens and Alien Resurrection (and Prometheus) and even straight up copying entire scenes from them.If I were to list all the callbacks this review would be a mile long.Ridley Scott and Fede Alvarez clearly wanted to give the Alien fans what they wanted: a bunch of memberberries, betting on nostalgia, and looking at the reviews, they succeeded.The android is good, the rest of the characters are very unlikeable.

I have a current smart tv, but it was still difficult to see what was going on in several dark scenes. Also, it was disjointed and lacked some cohesion. It was difficult to follow the thread, How the scenes fit together. Maybe it was because I had to focus so much on seeing many of the scenes due to the overuse of darkness.",2024-12-07

I doubt it.Many didn't like where the franchise was going but it was going somewhere unique. The quest for our origin now forgotten we're left with a familiar horror, dispatchable in droves by a teenager with a rifle.The alien, as a monster is bare, his anatomy well understood by the viewer and understandable by the cast in the space of 2 or 3 scenes. This explains the need for the abomination at the end, something fresh. Something exciting.While this new entry is Creepy, it would find a better home in other franchises. The grotesque figure is meant as a contrast to the sleek design of the alien. This is achieved but also lost is the the appeal of the black goo, turning any living thing into killer perfection.The ever younger casting was a mistake. The protagonists can't sell the resilience necessary of having lived under the conditions we're meant to believe they did.All in all the movie could stir the series in all sort of directions as elements of all previous entries are included.Will we get more of the same?",2024-10-16

It's Rise, and that's??",2024-11-24
1273,brimstoniusvomitus,"Exciting Fan Service That Doesn't Capture The Original ""Alien"" Horror",5,"Alien: Romulus (hereafter ""A:R"") isn't necessarily a bad film depending on what sort of audience you are and if you can weigh the context of current film-making trends and audience generational gaps. I suspect new/young fans of the Alien franchise will find A:R to be exciting and intriguing. Older, returning fans (such as myself) might be a bit jaded as to its offerings.For those older fans, we may have heard that A:R ""recaptures"" the horror of the franchise. I disagree. Speaking of Alien (1979) in particular, the horror came from subtlety, minimalism, and mystery. While there are sparse moments in A:R that are quiet/silent, most of its tension is built with action. Audio stings and visual jump scares were heavily relied upon. Rather than sitting on its scenes, quietly letting them breathe and build feelings of vulnerability in the audience, A:R rushes us from one shock to the next with racing visuals, panning cameras, and swelling choral music. This is exciting, I admit, but does not preserve the actual horror of the franchise.The story was serviceable as long as you're okay with characters and plot taking a back seat to pure spectacle. We get pulled forcefully by our noses through a ham-fisted setup that does no more than check the boxes we need to keep the film moving. Getting invested is another matter. As of 24 hours post-viewing, I only remember the names of 3 characters and I can give you two reasons why: One, the audio balancing was poor and it was hard to make out dialogue amidst the ambience and music, and two, the characters were designed as a means to an end. As long as you're viewing for the spectacle and not the plot/characters, you'll have a good time and to heck with names.Other aspects of the writing were also flawed. The story explains itself too much. Details of the xenomorph were fleshed out when we didn't really need them - maybe this is interesting material, but the more we know, the less mystery we're left with. Also, in terms of dialogue, there were egregious moments that shirk the ""Show, Don't Tell"" maxim of story writing. We didn't need to be told why a particular character is behaving the way they are with an immediate side bar conversation; just give us context clues, maybe a meaningful reveal later. It's as if Fede Alvarez - who is credited as screenwriter as well as director and executive producer - believes his audience to be simple-minded and in need of hand-holding.As to the casting, there are some lamentations on the characters' ages. Having seen the setup, I think it's fine and didn't bother me throughout the film. The acting is generally decent, though very little is noteworthy outside David Jonsson's work. The moments that felt flattest were often marred by editing. Also, did we need a deep fake for a nostalgia fix? I won't spoil who, but you'll know when you see it, and it looks awful and tasteless.What did NOT look awful and tasteless were the visuals. The scenes of space may have taken away the claustrophobia of the original Alien film, but the beauty of the ice rings and planetary atmosphere was a delight. Had this been a different kind of movie that focused on sci-fi space travel, I would've had a better time watching it. Visual effects throughout the film were overall impressive, often made better by use of practical effects over abundant CGI. Again, if you're of a mind that can enjoy spectacle without meaningful plot and characters, you'll dine well on A:R.I should conclude this review before I start writing out a play-by-play video essay: I personally found A:R to be ""okay."" It did the things it clearly wanted to do well. But as an older fan of the franchise, I felt no meaningful connection to this film and would have been content if it was never made. I didn't need an Alien:Romulus. I'm not sure I need any new Alien movies at all. As dated as the older films are, they are classics for a reason and, perhaps, the classics are not best served by modern widgets and tacky fan service.",2024-08-20
1274,noldorian_w,I've probably getting old...,5,"Ok this is clearly a tribute. No original ideas at all. After watching the film I got the same feeling that I got after watching Star Wars VII for the first time: It's a film that takes the original idea, remakes it and gives it to the new generation. Without any hesitation, without any shame. The creators believe or that we are morons, or they simply don't care. Practically by watching this film a teenager gets a sum up of all the previous films, gets all the classic scenes and all the cool ideas with state of the art special effects and excellent cinematography. But I personally felt like I've been fraud. Why don't we get any original ideas? Is that so hard nowadays? After watching the Star Wars sequels I started appreciating more the prequels, after watching Romulus I started appreciating more Alien Resurrection. At least these films had something new to say.

He'd rather attend comicons than finish what he started. So there's that.The director decided to include a scene showing an ancient Apple computer with a 3.5"" floppy drive as some sort of indication that this was a prequel to the Alien movies? Really? Our very different universes have the same exact 3.5"" floppy drives?If you love the Alien franchise so much that you will watch every single spin-off, this may be for you.I can't get about 30 minutes into it.IMHO, this is the worst ever attempted reboot of a major movie franchise.",2024-12-08

Its biggest strength is its modesty: there's no showboating or flaunting here, and it's not trying to pass off junk under the Alien logo. However, there's also not much else to it. If the crew were up against some brand-new creature rather than the iconic Alien monsters, it's unlikely the film would be pulling IMDb ratings above 7. There's hardly anything to say about story or acting, but the film delivers what it promises, and fans get just enough nods to the franchise in a decently made, cost-effective budget Alien sequel. It's less a spectacle, more a chamber piece, not so much a film as a TV movie, but it's self-aware and doesn't expect to be seen as anything more. This modesty, in turn, makes it likable.",2024-10-25

Direction was good but the suspense was traded for chase scenes. Tension wasn't really developed throughout and depth and charisma from the main character was missing. It really came across a teen movie starring teen actors despite their actual ages.It turned into a slasher chase em and the Alien Xenomorph was dumbed down and slowed down considerably. It's an OK movie but not one for the pantheon.Effects were very good however. Script could have been developed to provide greater depth.

They are very normal, even less than normal.But there are elements that deserve some praise like the performances of the cast, soundtrack, cinematography, and violence and brutality.But even with these elements, Alien Romulus remains a very normal movie, and from my point of view, it does not deserve more than 5 out of 10.",2024-08-30

The visual scenes, the gritty life of mankind we get to see. The spaceships looks good, and has that alien look. The story itself is good enough, not too complex, ""some kids try to loot a spacestation gone dark and end up with more than they bargained for"".But that unfortunatly is also the biggest problem with this movie. I dont get why someone thought it was a good idea to make a movie about teens in space. The carachters are so flat you couldn't care who lives or dies. For one thing it doesnt make sense that only a bunch of kids barley 21 happens to work a shuttle, second of all, most people that enjoyed the originals are atleast in their 30s and we feel left out.Second problem with this movie I think that stops this movie from being a big hit is the fact that it's not the least scary. This movie was made for tiktok-generation that needs something new to be introduced every minute, and theres no building of suspense.

A terrible cast.The scientific nature that the film has always had with the investigation is missing, because all the actors in the cast are the same profile without variety.They have spared a quality script that links the films well, creating a simple story that is well executed, but that lacks characters with depth and elements that give meaning to this entire universe and that answer the questions that we all asked ourselves when watching Prometheus and Covenant, which were the truly interesting thing in the evolution of the saga, beyond a slimy bug that kills on a ship.An acceptable movie but it would have been good with a little more script and a reasonable cast.",2024-08-25

I have absolutely nothing against Álvarez, but he also does not have the necessary talent for such a project.Following almost in a traced way the artistic and production concepts of the original Ridley Scott film, ""Romulus"" does not contribute absolutely anything to the saga, but it is obsessed with the phosphorus monitors, the noisy hydraulic machinery and the elevator buttons of the 60s. Ridley Scott, unable to predict the future, of course, made use of that technology of the moment to generate a futuristic atmosphere, and at the same time dirty and implacable. That is Production Design, and Fede has thought it appropriate to use the photocopies of those vignettes.Meanwhile, Álvarez himself, a big fan of the original saga, has recorded in his memory a lot of plans that his consciousness forces him to repeat, bypassing his own personality as director (if any) to adapt it to his childhood idols. And that is when Fede Álvarez remembers those travelings and persecutions that delighted us all in ""Jurassic Park"" and, of course, as a great lover of classic cinema, the guy thinks that it would be an original touch to add some sequence plane simulating the great Alfred Hitchcock's master piece ""The Birds.Really, I don't think Fede Álvarez was the most appropriate to give continuity to the saga that concerns us.

1285,reelreviewsandrecommendations,To Boldly Go,8,"In 2013, the first feature film by director Fede Alvarez was released: 'Evil Dead,' a reboot of the gloriously gory Sam Raimi series. While some found it lacked the humour the franchise was known for- and most missed Bruce Campbell's demon-killing badass Ash Williams- it was a bloody good film, paying homage to Raimi's original three, while standing on its own two feet. It seemed Alvarez was a new master of the macabre; a notion his next film, the claustrophobic 'Don't Breathe,' compounded.Having helmed a great new addition to a beloved franchise, and having proved himself adept at making grisly, tense features, Alvarez is the perfect choice to direct an 'Alien' film. 'Alien: Romulus,' set between the events of Ridley Scott's first 'Alien' and James Cameron's 'Aliens,' centres on a group of space colonists who come upon a derelict space station languishing amidst the stars. Intending to scavenge, they board, only to realize the station isn't really abandoned; and that which occupies it has murder on its xenomorphian mind.It is a gripping horror, a worthy companion piece to Scott's brilliant original. Whether or not you loved Cameron's blockbuster 'Aliens,' its success ensured that all of the succeeding movies in the franchise have been focused more on action rather than dread, on spectacle rather than horror. Although Alvarez has time for action- the latter half of the picture contains some excellent fight scenes, especially one in zero gravity- 'Alien: Romulus' shares the same tone of foreboding menace as the original.The xenomorphs are to be feared in Alvarez's film. They are not easily annihilated by myriads of weapons or exosuits. Similarly, the main character, Rain Carradine, is not an alien-killing-machine like Cameron's version of Ripley was. Rather, she is more like Ripley in her first cinematic outing: terrified, overwhelmed and in constant danger. She is a great conduit for the audience, as the film takes viewers on a journey into fear, in the confines of space; where no-one can hear you scream.Alvarez and co-writer Rodo Sayagues craft a tale both engaging and frightening, though a cynical critic might suggest their characterisation is a bit cliched. The supporting characters are particularly ill-served; some are little more than cardboard cut-outs- especially Bjorn, a needlessly aggressive chap whose characterisation seems to have come straight from the pages of a Dummies Guidebook for Scumbaggery. However, Rain and Andy- her synthetic companion- are compelling: one cares for them.The production design- headed by Naaman Marshall- is immersive and atmospheric, while the efficacious use of both special and practical effects generates many chills and thrills. Alvarez cleverly hired various set designers and decorators, as well as model makers and special effects crew, who worked on previous films in the series. Every location looks like it could have been used in the first movie, while the xenomorphs and other creatures look like they came straight from a HR Giger nightmare.Furthermore, director of photography Galo Olivares does sterling work under Alvarez's direction. The cinematography is striking and headily evocative. Their use of light and shadow is particularly effective at generating tension and intrigue, while irregular angles are utilised to further the film's suspenseful atmosphere. Further, they juxtapose the vastness of space with the cramped interiors of the station, generating the palpably anxious fear that made the franchise's first entry so memorable.In addition, they shoot the pulse-pounding action masterfully, leaving viewers on the edge of their seat throughout the film's two-hour runtime- which goes by swiftly, thanks to the fastidious editing from Alvarez and Jake Roberts. Furthermore, Benjamin Wallfisch's score is creepily unsettling, compounding the film's horror and heightening its apprehensive, unpredictable mood.Cailee Spaeny stars as Rain, delivering a sturdy performance that echoes Sigourney Weaver's as Ripley, though is in no way derivative of Weaver's work. She makes Rain compelling, and is difficult not to root for. As Andy, David Jonsson is brilliant, bringing a humanity to the role that is quite affecting- especially considering he isn't technically human. His relationship with Spaeny is the heart of the film; the two demonstrate a fine chemistry.Moreover, Archie Renaux does fine work as the leader of the boarding party, while Daniel Betts- with the help of CGI- is terrific, playing Rook, a science officer fans of the original will immediately recognise. Isabela Merced and Aileen Wu both also impress in smaller roles, though, conversely, Spike Fearn is incredibly irritating as Bjorn- although, since the character was surely written to be irritating, in a way, he fulfilled his brief more than adequately.In summation, Fede Alvarez's 'Alien: Romulus' is a fast-paced, frenetic entry in the 'Alien' franchise that acts as a homage to Ridley Scott's original, while making its own mark cinematically. Boasting a gripping narrative filled with chills and thrills, as well as striking cinematography and a stirring score, it fires on all cylinders. Well-edited and strongly acted, it is a terrific film, that boldly goes in new directions, while honouring where it came from.",2024-12-08
1286,bjornrhein,Another mess,5,"What is it with these alien movies and messy productions , blinking lights, explosions, water and chaos, just hard to followWell this is an ok movie I guess, its a safe card, follow the path and stick to the rules how to do an alien movie, and with that said I can like it for what its worth, cause its just like the other alien movies, even stolen parts from the other alien movies, and that includes the messy production aswell, but I was hoping for some different and clever script, now reinvent the wheel all over againThe story was hesitant, teenies in space was perhaps pointed for a younger targetgroup than my self but I think it was dumb anyway, the story has alot of shortcuts , first they speak of going away, next second they sit in a spaceshipAlso it was a feeling of low budget movie, many scenes didnt look like was it was supposed to look likeBut sure, its another alien movie that deliver action and thrilling moments, it was ok.",2024-12-08
1287,kalle-parviainen,High-budget Alien fan film,7,"A few hours after coming out of the theater and I'm not sure what to make of this. It was... okay, I guess?It felt like Fedy Alvarez examined the production of each of the previous films, and every left-over idea from them was thrown finally to the screen, along with rehashing the core components of the franchise. You have pieces from Alien, Aliens, Resurrection, and Prometheus/Covenant. For a fan of the series, there are subtle and not-so-subtle easter eggs every few minutes, from sound effects to reused dialogue.The plot is really simple, as it should be. A group of people exploring a space station. Been there, done that. However, I really liked the use of temperature and gravity in this film, those were something not seen much in this universe. And there were plenty of jump scares. I'm not usually a fan of those, but this time they worked well.The two lead actors were pretty good, the rest rather forgettable. And not sure what to make of the beyond-the-grave role of one actor...The world is great. Forget the sleek and clean world of Prometheus, this is back to the ugly 70s retro futuristic stuff. Simply lovely. Aesthetically pleasing, if you like this kind of look.Finally, however, it does feel like there is really nowhere for this franchise to go in terms of story. I wouldn't call it artistically bankrupt, but it is close. While this film tied neatly together the ""proper"" Alien films and the new Prometheus sidestep, it is hard to think what more to make of this creature. Nearly all the mystery has been stripped from the Xenomorph. I do wonder, is there anything left to do with this creature? More stand-alone films?",2024-08-14
1288,andyelliott-53082,An Alien Greatest Hits album sung by a cover band.,6,"Positives first - Good action, great practical special effects, and nice visuals.Director Fede Alvarez and his production team have captured the gloomy atmosphere of Alien, and the thrilling action of Aliens almost perfectly. The action was thrilling with some scary moments.The use of practical effects and realistic miniatures was so refreshing to see in this age of CGI overkill. Seeing a fully realised Xenomorph in the flesh blew me away, and the Space scenes were beautiful. This camera work, visual presentation, and use of quality albeit limited CGI when necessary was excellent.Negatives - Average acting, nostalgia bait story, copy & pasted dialogue from better Alien movies, and the inclusion of lore elements from the inferior prequels which I wish did not exist in official canon. Plus the reveal of the villain was an ""oh, get out of here "" moment, I will say no more.Apart from the great lead actress Spaeny playing up her role, the other cast of actors/characters was just okay. I thought the nostalgia bait story was boring, eye-rolling, and almost 4th wall breaking, it ruined the immersion for me. I'm getting bored of sequels/prequels heavily relying on lazy ""remember-berries"" to get a kick out of the casual audience while making the Alien fans embarrassed almost angry. To be honest it's just lazy script writing, and disrespectful to the other Alien movies that did it first!. Unnecessary.Also the overuse of copy & pasted dialogue from the better Sigourney Weaver Alien movies was very cringe. 20th Century Studios should've called it Alien: Remember because of the over-reliance on oh you remember this bit from.. Lastly, trying to inject all the controversial and franchise damaging Prometheus nonsense into the film was frustrating, I hated all that origin of the Space Jockey and creation of the Xenomorph rubbish. And don't get me started on the villain, I don't want to spoil anything, but it was laughably lazy.I think setting the movie between the first 2 films was a mistake because you have to make your movie fit into the established continuity of the franchise with all the tie ins and plot beats required to make it fit. They should've done a sequel set years after Alien: Resurrection, and setup the start of a brand new Alien saga long after Weavers adventures (and with better writers onboard).This had the potential to be right up there with Aliens, but due to disappointing characters, a lacklustre ""remember-berry"" story, and poor script, it was a let down. Alien: Romulus, an above average Alien greatest hits movie, 4th best film in the franchise.",2024-08-17
1289,bradaviel,The Rogue One of the Alien Franchise,8,"I had high hopes for this one and what can I say : I just got back into the theatre again after the first showing because I couldn't wait to see it a second time. Remember how we always wondered if Alien and Blade Runner took place in the same universe ? The world building was so well done and involving I was almost disappointed to remember after 30 minutes that I was to see an Alien movie. Almost. Because the rest is so good. The way the characters are built in relation to each other and against what's happening is masterful. I also love how the movie reunites thematically and lore wise ALL 6 movies that came before (there's a node to each and everyone of them and I'm a sucker for a good candy if it's done purposefully) while doing it's own thing. Because it IS a Fede Alvarez movie, as fresh and dynamic as the other movies he's done. Finally, you just have to see the opening : as soon as the computer lights up, you know where you are and you know it's gonna be as respectful and familiar as possible. True, there are liberties taken with the lore and some will argue on these with reason but I personally can forgive those shortcuts because they serve the pace (and every movie has its own specific Xenomorphs anyway). There's no down time, always something happening. It checks the boxes but it's also unique and special. This was well worth the wait.",2024-08-14
1290,Pigeons1,"""In space no one can hear you sigh""",6,"At this point in 2024, there are more bad alien movies than good ones. So, something that pays homage to the originals really piqued my interest.Visually, it's vintage ""Alien/s"" albeit with modern polish. It looks great, spectacular even, especially the space scenes. The opening scene was perfect.The main problem with the movie is that there is zero tension, no sense of dread, and it's not scary, except for the last few scenes, which I enjoyed.The movie tries to force tension and intensity with another plot device on top of the alien-the equivalent of a bomb timer countdown. It doesn't work as it trumps the alien threat, they become inconvenient road blocks.The facehuggers have been reduced to annoying pests-something you can just bat away.The aliens are cannon fodder, and the cast just seems to bump into them. I didn't get the sense that they were being hunted. E.g The sentry cannon scene from Aliens, this movie references. But you don't see the aliens dieing in Aliens, you do here which makes them look weak. On a side note this scene also reminded me of the Starwars prison corridor ""boring conversation anyway"".Many scenes played out like a QuickTime event in a video game, with characters over-explaining and then narrating their actions: ""I'm going to press X to do this."" It's as if the audience needs to be told what they're watching and why they should feel scared or tense because there is no tension in the scene, despite an alien being present.I have concerns about adding more law etc into the franchise. I don't need to know how the alien works, it's not scary if you know everything about a monster. That's the point of a monster. They use this new found law to get past some aliens, again it was like a scene from a video game.It really nails the alien aesthetic, its a high paced movie with video game level writing and characters. Somewhat fun but ultimately disposable.",2024-08-15
1291,pootc,All too familiar,6,"Alien: Romulus delivers a gritty experience reminiscent of the original film, with impressive world-building and familiar tech that longtime fans of the franchise will appreciate. The movie captures the essence of the Alien universe, offering a standalone story that fits well within the established timeline and cleverly nods to Prometheus.However, the film's reliance on callbacks to previous entries in the franchise detracts from its originality. While some references are clever, others are forced and cringeworthy.The introduction of the main character Rain, played by Cailee Spaeny, feels uninspired. We've seen this before - another Ripley. It's actually David Jonsson's character, Andy, who ends up being the most interesting by a long shot. If there is one franchise that would benefit from exploring new characters rather than rehashing old ones, this is it.Despite these negatives, Romulus is technically impressive. It's beautifully shot, the effects are good, it has some genuine scares, and manages to deliver solid thrills and action scenes that are sure to please. I just wish it were brave enough to carve out its own identity.",2024-08-17

Don't you dare to be original like 'Prometheus' or bold, like 'Alien: Covenant'. Just give the audience familiarity and play it somewhat safe.In a world where most new movies coming out from Hollywood are either reboots, remakes or sequels and where new ideas being greenlit are things of the past (unless it can be made on a small budget), we are being flooded with try-to-check-all-boxes movies with several screenwriters and focusgroups attached.Consider me worried.",2024-08-20
1293,valmont1702,"Checks all the boxes, and more !...",8,"If you love the Alien franchise, there's a big chance this movie is gonna satisfy you quite a bit... Because it combines most of the notable elements that made the franchise oh so popular across the years (cf. There are multiple winks or easter eggs to the various movies of the franchise, via subtle elements, characters or story plots)...It is of course a product of our modern era (the filming technics, the effects), while also keeping most of the classic atmosphere and tone of the Alien movies...The visual language is pretty excellent overall, with some really striking shots here and there (great framing and composition)...Yes it might disappoint some, who have a feeling of ownership towards the franchise, because it definitely expands and explores the lore quite a lot (which is what I personally am looking for with sci-fi sagas that go on and on over decades)... Also, the lead actress (Cailee Spaeny) carries the movie really well, with silent strength, subtlety and intensity...So if you're looking for an Alien movie that uses most of the old ingredients while reintroducing and/or reinventing them, and exploring beyond what we've been used to... Then you're up for a great time !",2024-08-14

No real tension, once you realize the generic script was going to stay that way. The 'twist' was as predictable as they come. Acting generic. Though Andy had his moments. The throwbacks to previous films were eye rolling and the rehash of the famous Aliens line was the most cringe of all. Even some of the sets looked cheap. I particularly remember a couple scenes that looked like they were hanging up those circular metallic bendable dryer vents. Everything was super dark, probably to hide what was probably terrible quality alien slime/hard mucus lining the walls. The face huggers particularly at the beginning looked very cheaply done. Stiff and jittery.Big letdown.",2024-08-17

It was just a mess of red lights and repeated visual effects, an uninspired collage of shots that recall scenes from each and every Alien movie. What was the point of making something like this? Was it to put the final nail in the coffin for the Alien saga? It seems long overdue!The inclusion of teenagers in the plot is completely illogical, even if they are supposedly tech-savvy. We're not talking about using a microwave or the latest smartphone here; this is advanced space technology! The whole thing is nonsense, with incoherent storytelling and a lack of real suspense. I've wasted two hours of my time !",2024-10-15

I have seen and enjoyed all the films many times over and appreciated the less popular ones in the series. Seeing Romulus was a disappointment. Its dark visuals, particularly the opening sequence, had me confused at times. The relevance of the opener became obvious later on. And the dialogue was muffled in spots, and I missed chunks trying to figure out what was said, thus missing the follow up. The story was uninspiring and the Xenomorphs were identical to previous incarnations (for the most part) and close ups of the mouth parts no longer cause fear or dread, just boredom. This is one in the franchise that I may not watch again.",2024-08-17
1297,SeeRJay,Patience will be rewarded - the third act makes the trip worthwhile,9,"First and foremost, Alien: Romulus is an unabashed love letter to Alien, Aliens and - much to my delight - Alien: Isolation. There hasn't been a film or piece of media that has felt quite as loyal to the original's vision in a long time, if ever.Almost to a fault, the first two acts deify Alien and Aliens, occasionally lifting dialogue and scene composition verbatim. Those parts are nice throwbacks, although I couldn't help but want something fresh and genuinely terrifying - a feat which I don't think has been achieved since the films that Alien: Romulus lovingly imitates. At the very least, it never ceases to be engaging science fiction-horror.The characters are moderately interesting, with some believable backstories to justify their motivations, but it isn't difficult to distinguish the heroes from the fodder early on. The dynamic between Rain and Andy is a particular highlight, and gives the narrative the anchor that it needs to warrant the audience's investment. Cailee Spaeney's and David Jonsson's performances are excellent, with the latter delivering the nuance required of his character with precision. The practical effects are also fantastic, making the CGI - when it is used - stand out to the film's detriment.While the first two acts in isolation deliver a satisfactory entry in the series, the third act (you will know when it arrives) is the white-knuckle horror ride that has been lacking in the more recent films. It's also the point in which the film matures, so to speak, distinguishing itself from a homage and transforming into a standalone experience. It really is best viewed free of any spoilers - all I will say is that it is the first time I've involuntarily gasped in the series since seeing Alien for the first time.Patience will be rewarded - the third act makes the ride more than worthwhile, and reminded me of exactly why I love the series.",2024-08-14

I honestly didn't have any emotional attachment to the majority of the characters and most of them were just annoying and thick.The movie was tawdry at times, seeming to take an age to get going and relying far to heavily on Alien franchise cliches to add any real colour to the plot and script.The special effects were good enough and the design on the original xenomorph was excellent, although the face huggers look worse in this film than they did in Alien and Aliens for some reason.Don't ger over excited by the current hype surrounding Romulus, it isn't a terrible film but it isn't a great one either.

Once the action gets going, you do have lots of good moments but overall so many over the top moments, it was clearly made to be more of a teen action movie.No real horror or mystery elements. And repeating, extremely repeating, always adding one more layer on layer but always the same.Then the end, last 10min were nice, but then again so dumb behavior and moves that you can just laugh and shake your head.Where are the beautiful mystery elements from prometheus and covenant?A real pity.

However, once at the ship they find it is actually a Weyland-Yutani research facility and, although there are no humans left aboard, it is far from empty....I am a huge fan of the Alien Films and had watched the approach of this 7th Film with a mixture of both curiosity and trepidation. After all, Alien Films are not released very regularly and the 'Fanbase' has now polarised into two camps - one that simply wants to watch 'more of the same' Alien (Xenomorph on scary spaceship picking off victims etc) or those who want a bigger exploration of the 'Alien Universe' (Prometheus, Covenant).Despite the endorsements of both Ridley Scott & James Cameron (now both in hock to the 'Mouse-house' Disney) I suspected that this Film would be a 'mash up' of sorts between 'Alien' & 'Aliens' - just with a younger Cast. Unfortunately, Disney have shown that they are creatively bankrupt and are more than happy to simply produce a 'copy & paste' rehash of what we have seen before...
Alien: Romulus has a couple of good set pieces and a couple of decent acting performances BUT it just cannot disguise the fact that it is a patchwork of nods & call backs to virtually every Alien Film made! Whole chunks of dialogue and lines are spouted verbatim from 'Alien' and 'Aliens', which was just an unnecessary distraction. The 'Rook/Ash' inclusion was also overdone. The net result for me was a Film that looked and sounded like a Lazy reboot of several Alien Films but with NO original ideas. The practical effects were well done BUT the impact was diminished by the overly familiar tropes - and dialogue.The 'Finale' was blatant 'remix' of the creature from 'Alien Resurrection' with a bit of 'Prometheus' Engineer thrown in!Cailee Spaeny makes an endearing if reluctant hero as Rain, while David Jonsson's 'artificial person' Andy struggles with his 'directives'. Unfortunately neither of these two can match Weaver's original Ripley or Fassbender's deeply unnerving 'David' from the other Films.So, Alien: Romulus (for me) simply didn't do anything to expand the Alien Universe or indeed even go for a more original take. Instead I found myself watching a 2 hour 'replay' of 'Alien Greatest Hits' which appeared to have been designed for 'Fanboys' and video-game youngsters. In some parts I even felt it bordered on parody!As for this being the 'Best' Alien Film since Cameron's 'Aliens' in 1986 - forget it!At least Alien 3, 'Prometheus' and even 'Covenant' tried to be different.'Alien: Romulus' has successfully rehashed all the old Alien tropes for a new audience but, in the process, has now painted the Franchise into a corner.The 'haunted spaceship' has now been done to death - unless Scott himself has anything further to say, Alien is going nowhere...",2024-08-31

1302,kcsuper,The Director gets it!,8,"Managed to snag an early screening of Alien: Romulus, and let me just say this....... Fede Alvarez understands the suspense this franchise needs. Despite the obvious inspiration from the Alien: Isolation video game, which is not a bad thing AT ALL, Alvarez provides the old school fan service we've been missing.The not-so well known cast pulls it off convincingly, particularly Cailee Spaeny as Rain. Although I didn't much care for her character in Civil War, here she sells her performance rather well. Many will view her as primarily an Amanda Ripley knock-off, though. The Xenomorph design in this one is somewhat reminiscent of the original '79, and it does NOT disappoint. It's almost as if ""Kane's Son"" from the Nostromo floated through space and landed on the Renaissance Station.That feeling of isolated dread carries the film, and keeps you on the edge of your seat, but it has has a tendency to drag, but you barely notice it. As far as facehuggers go.......this film does them justice! Holy 🐄! They give the creatures they spawn a run for their money as top contender for terrifying. Take the ones who attacked Ripley and Newt in Aliens and dip them in cocaine. That's what you get in this one! All in all, Alien: Romulus comes in third in this franchise. Alien 3, Resurrection, Prometheus, and Covenant can be erased from canon in my opinion. Enjoy fans!",2024-08-14

But it is let down in various ways:Too many needless quotes spoken word for word from previous films as if that will excite our nostalgia, but honestly those lines were delivered perfectly with impact and timing when used originally and just repeating this as off the cuff dialog in new characters treads far too closely to ruining their legacy.Some connections to previous films that I don't like are validated. The lore appears to be permanently lessened as to the origin of the species amongst other things.Some scenes and situations from previous films are copied, again needlessly. There are several of these.At times it feels like there are jump scares every 5 minutes in parts, way overdone.
